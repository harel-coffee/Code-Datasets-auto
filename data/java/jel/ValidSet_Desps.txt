Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified collection Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate link ClassCastException Assuming a collection contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated and that all subsequent access to the collection takes place through the view it is guaranteed that the collection cannot contain an incorrectly typed element The generics mechanism in the language provides compiletime static type checking but it is possible to defeat this mechanism with unchecked casts Usually this is not a problem as the compiler issues warnings on all such unchecked operations There are however times when static type checking alone is not sufficient For example suppose a collection is passed to a thirdparty library and it is imperative that the library code not corrupt the collection by inserting an element of the wrong type Another use of dynamically typesafe views is debugging Suppose a program fails with a code ClassCastException indicating that an incorrectly typed element was put into a parameterized collection Unfortunately the exception can occur at any time after the erroneous element is inserted so it typically provides little or no information as to the real source of the problem If the problem is reproducible one can quickly determine its source by temporarily modifying the program to wrap the collection with a dynamically typesafe view For example this declaration code Collection c new HashSet may be replaced temporarily by this one code Collection c CollectionscheckedCollection new HashSet Stringclass Running the program again will cause it to fail at the point where an incorrectly typed element is inserted into the collection clearly identifying the source of the problem Once the problem is fixed the modified declaration may be reverted back to the original The returned collection does not pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing collection but relies on code Object's code equals and code hashCode methods This is necessary to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case that the backing collection is a set or a list The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection is serializable Since code null is considered to be a value of any reference type the returned collection permits insertion of null elements whenever the backing collection does

Reads an unshared object from the ObjectInputStream This method is identical to readObject except that it prevents subsequent calls to readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the deserialized instance obtained via this call Specifically If readUnshared is called to deserialize a backreference the stream representation of an object which has been written previously to the stream an ObjectStreamException will be thrown If readUnshared returns successfully then any subsequent attempts to deserialize backreferences to the stream handle deserialized by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle associated with the returned object Note that this in itself does not always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an object visible to other parties or readUnshared may return a Class object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through external means If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method and the invocation of that method returns an array then readUnshared returns a shallow clone of that array this guarantees that the returned array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be constructed in security contexts possessing the enableSubclassImplementation SerializablePermission any attempt to instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a SecurityException to be thrown

Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name target locale class loader and control Unlike the linkplain getBundleString Locale ClassLoader getBundle factory methods with no control argument the given control specifies how to locate and instantiate resource bundles Conceptually the bundle loading process with the given control is performed in the following steps This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for the specified baseName targetLocale and loader If the requested resource bundle instance is found in the cache and the timetolive periods of the instance and all of its parent instances have not expired the instance is returned to the caller Otherwise this factory method proceeds with the loading process below The link ResourceBundleControlgetFormatsString controlgetFormats method is called to get resource bundle formats to produce bundle or resource names The strings javaclass and javaproperties designate classbased and linkplain PropertyResourceBundle propertybased resource bundles respectively Other strings starting with java are reserved for future extensions and must not be used for

instantiate a ResourceBundle for the base bundle name a candidate locale and a format Refer to the note on the cache lookup below This step is iterated over all combinations of the candidate locales and formats until the newBundle method returns a ResourceBundle instance or the iteration has used up all the combinations For example if the candidate locales are Localede DE Localede and Locale and

contained locales other than Locale put the bundle on hold and proceed to Step If a bundle has been found that is not a base bundle proceed to Step The link ResourceBundleControlgetFallbackLocaleString Locale controlgetFallbackLocale method is called to get a fallback locale alternative to the current target locale to try further finding a resource bundle If the method returns a nonnull locale it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over from Step Otherwise if a base bundle was found and put on hold in a previous Step it is returned to the caller now Otherwise a MissingResourceException is thrown At this point we have found a resource bundle that's not the base bundle If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation it is returned to the caller Otherwise its a hrefResourceBundlehtmlparent_chainparent chain is instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was found Finally the bundle is returned to the caller During the resource bundle loading process above this factory method looks up the cache before calling the link ControlnewBundleString Locale String ClassLoader boolean controlnewBundle method If the timetolive period of the resource bundle found in the cache has expired the factory method calls the link ResourceBundleControlneedsReloadString Locale String ClassLoader ResourceBundle long controlneedsReload method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded If reloading is required the factory method calls controlnewBundle to reload the resource bundle If controlnewBundle returns null the factory method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for subsequent requests Such dummy resource bundles are under the same expiration control as specified by control All resource bundles loaded are cached by default Refer to link ControlgetTimeToLiveStringLocale

following sequence class foobarMessages_it_IT file foobarMessages_it_ITproperties class foobarMessages_it file foobarMessages_itproperties class foobarMessages file foobarMessagesproperties At this point getBundle finds foobarMessagesproperties which is put on hold because it's the base bundle getBundle calls link ControlgetFallbackLocaleString Locale controlgetFallbackLocalefoobarMessages LocaleITALY which returns LocaleFRENCH Next getBundle tries loading a bundle in the following sequence class foobarMessages_fr file foobarMessages_frproperties class foobarMessages file foobarMessagesproperties getBundle finds foobarMessages_frproperties and creates a ResourceBundle instance Then getBundle sets up its parent chain from the list of the candiate locales Only foobarMessagesproperties is found in the list and getBundle creates a ResourceBundle instance that becomes the parent of the instance for foobarMessages_frproperties

Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup The general contract of finalize is that it is invoked if and when the JavaTM virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died except as a result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be finalized The finalize method may take any action including making this object available again to other threads the usual purpose of finalize however is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably discarded For example the finalize method for an object that represents an inputoutput connection might perform explicit IO transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently discarded The finalize method of class Object performs no special action it simply returns normally Subclasses of Object may override this definition The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the finalize method for any given object It is guaranteed however that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any uservisible synchronization locks when finalize is invoked If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates After the finalize method has been invoked for an object no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized at which point the object may be discarded The finalize method is never invoked more than once by a Java virtual machine for any given object Any exception thrown by the finalize method causes the finalization of this object to be halted but is otherwise ignored

Signed addition built upon unsigned add and subtract
Get the value of the named float field from the persistent field
Set the TTL timetolive option
Returns the preference node from the system preference tree that is associated by convention with the specified class's package The convention is as follows the absolute path name of the node is the fully qualified package name preceded by a slash '' and with each period '' replaced by a slash For example the absolute path name of the node associated with the class comacmewidgetFoo is comacmewidget This convention does not apply to the unnamed package whose associated preference node is ltunnamedgt This node is not intended for long term use but for convenience in the early development of programs that do not yet belong to a package and for throwaway programs Valuable data should not be stored at this node as it is shared by all programs that use it A class Foo wishing to access preferences pertaining to its package can obtain a preference node as follows static Preferences prefs PreferencessystemNodeForPackageFooclass This idiom obviates the need for using a string to describe the preferences node and decreases the likelihood of a runtime failure If the class name is misspelled it will typically result in a compiletime error Invoking this method will result in the creation of the returned node and its ancestors if they do not already exist If the returned node did not exist prior to this call this node and any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until the flush method is called on the returned node or one of its ancestors or descendants
Returns true if the named preference node exists in the same tree as this node Relative path names which do not begin with the slash character '' are interpreted relative to this preference node If this node or an ancestor has already been removed with the link removeNode method it is legal to invoke this method but only with the path name the invocation will return false Thus the idiom pnodeExists may be used to test whether p has been removed
Causes this thread to begin execution the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread The result is that two threads are running concurrently the current thread which returns from the call to the start method and the other thread which executes its run method It is never legal to start a thread more than once In particular a thread may not be restarted once it has completed execution
Advances the iterator either forward or backward the specified number of steps Negative values move backward and positive values move forward This is equivalent to repeatedly calling next or previous
