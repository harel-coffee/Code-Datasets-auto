Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the bootstrap class loader When the virtual machine's builtin class loader known as the bootstrap class loader unsuccessfully searches for a class the entries in the link javautiljarJarFile JAR file will be searched as well This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be searched in the order that this method was invoked The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap class loader for the purpose of instrumentation Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected behaviour that is difficult to diagnose For example suppose there is a loader L and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader Furthermore a method in class C a class defined by L makes reference to a nonpublic accessor class C If the JAR file contains a class C then the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C to be defined by the bootstrap class loader In this example an IllegalAccessError will be thrown that may cause the application to fail One approach to avoiding these types of issues is to use a unique package name for the instrumentation classes The Java Virtual Machine Specification specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the initial resolution attempt Consequently if the JAR file contains an entry that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference then subsequent attempts to resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt

This method modifies the failure handling of native method resolution by allowing retry with a prefix applied to the name When used with the link javalanginstrumentClassFileTransformer ClassFileTransformer it enables native methods to be instrumented Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented they have no bytecodes they must be wrapped with a nonnative method which can be instrumented For example if we had native boolean fooint x We could transform the class file with the ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition of the class so that this becomes boolean fooint x record entry to foo return wrapped_foox native boolean wrapped_fooint x Where foo becomes a wrapper for the actual native method with the appended prefix wrapped_ Note that wrapped_ would be a poor choice of prefix since it might conceivably form the name of an existing method thus something like MyAgentWrapped_ would be better but would make these examples less readable The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native method call but now the problem becomes linking up the wrapped method with the native implementation That is the method wrapped_foo needs to be resolved to the native implementation of foo which might be Java_somePackage_someClass_fooJNIEnv env jint x This function allows the prefix to be specified and the proper resolution to occur Specifically when the standard resolution fails the resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration There are two ways that resolution occurs explicit resolution with the JNI function RegisterNatives and the normal automatic resolution For RegisterNatives the JVM will attempt this association methodfoo nativeImplementationfoo When this fails the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix prepended to the method name yielding the correct resolution methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationfoo For automatic resolution the JVM will attempt methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationwrapped_foo When this fails the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name yielding the correct resolution methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationfoo Note that since the prefix is only used when standard resolution fails native methods can be wrapped selectively Since each ClassFileTransformer can do its own transformation of the bytecodes more than one layer of wrappers may be applied Thus each transformer needs its own prefix Since transformations are applied in order the prefixes if applied will be applied in the same order see link addTransformerClassFileTransformerboolean addTransformer Thus if three transformers applied wrappers foo might become trans_trans_trans_foo But if say the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to foo it would be just trans_trans_foo To be able to efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes an intermediate prefix is only applied if its nonnative wrapper exists Thus in the last example even though trans_foo is not a native method the trans_ prefix is applied since trans_foo exists

Returns the next pseudorandom uniformly distributed code double value between code and code from this random number generator's sequence The general contract of code nextDouble is that one code double value chosen approximately uniformly from the range code d inclusive to code d exclusive is pseudorandomly generated and returned The method code nextDouble is implemented by class code Random as if by code public double nextDouble return longnext next doubleL The hedge approximately is used in the foregoing description only because the code next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits If it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits then the algorithm shown would choose code double values from the stated range with perfect uniformity In early versions of Java the result was incorrectly calculated as code return longnext next doubleL This might seem to be equivalent if not better but in fact it introduced a large nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floatingpoint numbers it was three times as likely that the loworder bit of the significand would be than that it would be This nonuniformity probably doesn't matter much in practice but we strive for perfection

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing larger fields If the specified amount is this method performs nothing This method calls link complete before adding the amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized If there is any calendar field having an outofrange value in nonlenient mode then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown Example Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to August Calling rollCalendarMONTH sets the calendar to April Using a GregorianCalendar the DAY_OF_MONTH field cannot be in the month April DAY_OF_MONTH is set to the closest possible value The YEAR field maintains the value of because it is a larger field than MONTH Example Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to Sunday June Calling rollCalendarWEEK_OF_MONTH sets the calendar to Tuesday June whereas calling addCalendarWEEK_OF_MONTH sets the calendar to Sunday May This is because the roll rule imposes an additional constraint The MONTH must not change when the WEEK_OF_MONTH is rolled Taken together with add rule the resultant date must be between Tuesday June and Saturday June According to add rule the DAY_OF_WEEK an invariant when changing the WEEK_OF_MONTH is set to Tuesday the closest possible value to Sunday where Sunday is the first day of the week
Retrieves and removes the last element of this deque or returns null if this deque is empty
Writes an unshared object to the ObjectOutputStream This method is identical to writeObject except that it always writes the given object as a new unique object in the stream as opposed to a backreference pointing to a previously serialized instance Specifically An object written via writeUnshared is always serialized in the same manner as a newly appearing object an object that has not been written to the stream yet regardless of whether or not the object has been written previously If writeObject is used to write an object that has been previously written with writeUnshared the previous writeUnshared operation is treated as if it were a write of a separate object In other words ObjectOutputStream will never generate backreferences to object data written by calls to writeUnshared While writing an object via writeUnshared does not in itself guarantee a unique reference to the object when it is deserialized it allows a single object to be defined multiple times in a stream so that multiple calls to readUnshared by the receiver will not conflict Note that the rules described above only apply to the baselevel object written with writeUnshared and not to any transitively referenced subobjects in the object graph to be serialized ObjectOutputStream subclasses which override this method can only be constructed in security contexts possessing the enableSubclassImplementation SerializablePermission any attempt to instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a SecurityException to be thrown

Compares the specified object with this collection for equality While the Collection interface adds no stipulations to the general contract for the Objectequals programmers who implement the Collection interface directly in other words create a class that is a Collection but is not a Set or a List must exercise care if they choose to override the Objectequals It is not necessary to do so and the simplest course of action is to rely on Object's implementation but the implementor may wish to implement a value comparison in place of the default reference comparison The List and Set interfaces mandate such value comparisons The general contract for the Objectequals method states that equals must be symmetric in other words aequalsb if and only if bequalsa The contracts for Listequals and Setequals state that lists are only equal to other lists and sets to other sets Thus a custom equals method for a collection class that implements neither the List nor Set interface must return false when this collection is compared to any list or set By the same logic it is not possible to write a class that correctly implements both the Set and List interfaces

Lazily loads the available providers of this loader's service The iterator returned by this method first yields all of the elements of the provider cache in instantiation order It then lazily loads and instantiates any remaining providers adding each one to the cache in turn To achieve laziness the actual work of parsing the available providerconfiguration files and instantiating providers must be done by the iterator itself Its link javautilIteratorhasNext hasNext and link javautilIteratornext next methods can therefore throw a link ServiceConfigurationError if a providerconfiguration file violates the specified format or if it names a provider class that cannot be found and instantiated or if the result of instantiating the class is not assignable to the service type or if any other kind of exception or error is thrown as the next provider is located and instantiated To write robust code it is only necessary to catch link ServiceConfigurationError when using a service iterator If such an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next available provider but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed span stylepaddingright em fontweight boldDesign Note Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme The rationale for this behavior is that a malformed providerconfiguration file like a malformed class file indicates a serious problem with the way the Java virtual machine is configured or is being used As such it is preferable to throw an error rather than try to recover or even worse fail silently The iterator returned by this method does not support removal Invoking its link javautilIteratorremove remove method will cause an link UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire in shared mode This has the same properties as link getQueuedThreads except that it only returns those threads waiting due to a shared acquire
Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified list Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate link ClassCastException Assuming a list contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated and that all subsequent access to the list takes place through the view it is guaranteed that the list cannot contain an incorrectly typed element A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the link checkedCollection checkedCollection method The returned list will be serializable if the specified list is serializable Since code null is considered to be a value of any reference type the returned list permits insertion of null elements whenever the backing list does
Creates and returns a copy of this object The precise meaning of copy may depend on the class of the object The general intent is that for any object x the expression xclone x will be true and that the expression xclonegetClass xgetClass will be true but these are not absolute requirements While it is typically the case that xcloneequalsx will be true this is not an absolute requirement By convention the returned object should be obtained by calling superclone If a class and all of its superclasses except Object obey this convention it will be the case that xclonegetClass xgetClass By convention the object returned by this method should be independent of this object which is being cloned To achieve this independence it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by superclone before returning it Typically this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal deep structure of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by superclone need to be modified The method clone for class Object performs a specific cloning operation First if the class of this object does not implement the interface Cloneable then a CloneNotSupportedException is thrown Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable Otherwise this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object as if by assignment the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned Thus this method performs a shallow copy of this object not a deep copy operation The class Object does not itself implement the interface Cloneable so calling the clone method on an object whose class is Object will result in throwing an exception at run time
Makes an attempt to skip over n bytes of data from the input stream discarding the skipped bytes However it may skip over some smaller number of bytes possibly zero This may result from any of a number of conditions reaching end of file before n bytes have been skipped is only one possibility This method never throws an EOFException The actual number of bytes skipped is returned

Advances the iterator backwards to the last boundary preceding this one
Get the previous collation element in the string This iterator iterates over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string Because there isn't necessarily a onetoone mapping from characters to collation elements this doesn't mean the same thing as return the collation element or ordering priority of the previous character in the string This function updates the iterator's internal pointer to point to the collation element preceding the one it's currently pointing to and then returns that element while next returns the current element and then updates the pointer This means that when you change direction while iterating ie call next and then call previous or call previous and then call next you'll get back the same element twice
Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is a site local address

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal data structures This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state not for synchronization control
Acquires the lock only if it is not held by another thread at the time of invocation Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread and returns immediately with the value code true setting the lock hold count to one Even when this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy a call to code tryLock will immediately acquire the lock if it is available whether or not other threads are currently waiting for the lock This quotbargingquot behavior can be useful in certain circumstances even though it breaks fairness If you want to honor the fairness setting for this lock then use link tryLocklong TimeUnit tryLock TimeUnitSECONDS which is almost equivalent it also detects interruption If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and the method returns code true If the lock is held by another thread then this method will return immediately with the value code false

Gets the Collator for the desired locale
Possibly reduce head level if it has no nodes This method can rarely make mistakes in which case levels can disappear even though they are about to contain index nodes This impacts performance not correctness To minimize mistakes as well as to reduce hysteresis the level is reduced by one only if the topmost three levels look empty Also if the removed level looks nonempty after CAS we try to change it back quick before anyone notices our mistake This trick works pretty well because this method will practically never make mistakes unless current thread stalls immediately before first CAS in which case it is very unlikely to stall again immediately afterwards so will recover We put up with all this rather than just let levels grow because otherwise even a small map that has undergone a large number of insertions and removals will have a lot of levels slowing down access more than would an occasional unwanted reduction

Returns the string representation of this code BigDecimal using scientific notation if an exponent is needed A standard canonical string form of the code BigDecimal is created as though by the following steps first the absolute value of the unscaled value of the code BigDecimal is converted to a string in base ten using the characters code '' through code '' with no leading zeros except if its value is zero in which case a single code '' character is used Next an adjusted exponent is calculated this is the negated scale plus the number of characters in the converted unscaled value less one That is code scaleulength where code ulength is the length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal digits its precision If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to code the number will be converted to a character form without using exponential notation In this case if the scale is zero then no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the number of characters to the right of the decimal point code '' characters are added to the left of the converted unscaled value as necessary If no character precedes the decimal point after this insertion then a conventional code '' character is prefixed Otherwise that is if the scale is negative or the adjusted exponent is less than code the number will be converted to a character form using exponential notation In this case if the converted code BigInteger has more than one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted unscaled value perhaps with inserted decimal point this comprises the letter code 'E' followed immediately by the adjusted exponent converted to a character form The latter is in base ten using the characters code '' through code '' with no leading zeros and is always prefixed by a sign character code '' 'uD' if the adjusted exponent is negative code '' 'uB' otherwise Finally the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character code '' 'uD' if the unscaled value is less than zero No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is zero or positive Examples For each representation unscaled value scale on the left the resulting string is shown on the right E E E E Notes There is a onetoone mapping between the distinguishable code BigDecimal values and the result of this conversion That is every distinguishable code BigDecimal value unscaled value and scale has a unique string representation as a result of using code toString If that string representation is converted back to a code BigDecimal using the link BigDecimalString constructor then the original value will be recovered The string produced for a given number is always the same it is not affected by locale This means that it can be used as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal data or as a key for a Hashtable etc Localesensitive number formatting and parsing is handled by the link javatextNumberFormat class and its subclasses The link toEngineeringString method may be used for presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation and the link setScaleintRoundingMode setScale method may be used for rounding a code BigDecimal so it has a known number of digits after the decimal point The digittocharacter mapping provided by code CharacterforDigit is used

Sets a default proposed value for the SO_RCVBUF option for sockets accepted from this ServerSocket The value actually set in the accepted socket must be determined by calling link SocketgetReceiveBufferSize after the socket is returned by link accept The value of SO_RCVBUF is used both to set the size of the internal socket receive buffer and to set the size of the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer It is possible to change the value subsequently by calling link SocketsetReceiveBufferSizeint However if the application wishes to allow a receive window larger than K bytes as defined by RFC then the proposed value must be set in the ServerSocket before it is bound to a local address This implies that the ServerSocket must be created with the noargument constructor then setReceiveBufferSize must be called and lastly the ServerSocket is bound to an address by calling bind Failure to do this will not cause an error and the buffer size may be set to the requested value but the TCP receive window in sockets accepted from this ServerSocket will be no larger than K bytes

Get the set of this engine's properties This set is a live view so that changing its contents immediately affects the Packer engine and changes from the engine such as progress indications are immediately visible in the map The property map may contain predefined implementation specific and default properties Users are encouraged to read the information and fully understand the implications before modifying preexisting properties Implementation specific properties are prefixed with a package name associated with the implementor beginning with com or a similar prefix All property names beginning with pack and unpack are reserved for use by this API Unknown properties may be ignored or rejected with an unspecified error and invalid entries may cause an unspecified error to be thrown The returned map implements all optional link SortedMap operations
Resolves instances being deserialized to the predefined constants
Returns a string describing this code Method including type parameters The string is formatted as the method access modifiers if any followed by an anglebracketed commaseparated list of the method's type parameters if any followed by the method's generic return type followed by a space followed by the class declaring the method followed by a period followed by the method name followed by a parenthesized commaseparated list of the method's generic formal parameter types A space is used to separate access modifiers from one another and from the type parameters or return type If there are no type parameters the type parameter list is elided if the type parameter list is present a space separates the list from the class name If the method is declared to throw exceptions the parameter list is followed by a space followed by the word throws followed by a commaseparated list of the generic thrown exception types If there are no type parameters the type parameter list is elided The access modifiers are placed in canonical order as specified by The Java Language Specification This is code public code protected or code private first and then other modifiers in the following order code abstract code static code final code synchronized code native
Returns the number of elements in this set its cardinality
Gets all the available IDs supported
Implements absolute timed condition wait If current thread is interrupted throw InterruptedException Save lock state returned by link getState Invoke link release with saved state as argument throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails Block until signalled interrupted or timed out Reacquire by invoking specialized version of link acquire with saved state as argument If interrupted while blocked in step throw InterruptedException If timed out while blocked in step return false else true 
Protected convenience method to report an error to this Handler's ErrorManager Note that this method retrieves and uses the ErrorManager without doing a security check It can therefore be used in environments where the caller may be nonprivileged
Attempts to read in the next block data header if any If canBlock is false and a full header cannot be read without possibly blocking returns HEADER_BLOCKED else if the next element in the stream is a block data header returns the block data length specified by the header else returns 
Specifies the domain within which this cookie should be presented The form of the domain name is specified by RFC A domain name begins with a dot foocom and means that the cookie is visible to servers in a specified Domain Name System DNS zone for example wwwfoocom but not abfoocom By default cookies are only returned to the server that sent them
Closes the stream This method must be called to release any resources associated with the stream
Returns a percentage format for the specified locale
Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this preference node The returned array will be of size zero if this node has no preferences If the implementation supports stored defaults and there are any such defaults at this node that have not been overridden by explicit preferences the defaults are returned in the array in addition to any explicit preferences
Returns a collection containing those threads that may be waiting on this Condition Implements link AbstractQueuedSynchronizergetWaitingThreads
Get the value of the named double field from the persistent field
Leave a multicast group Its behavior may be affected by setInterface or setNetworkInterface If there is a security manager this method first calls its checkMulticast method with the mcastaddr argument as its argument
Returns sqrtxnbspy without intermediate overflow or underflow Special cases If either argument is infinite then the result is positive infinity If either argument is NaN and neither argument is infinite then the result is NaN 
Copies the elements from our element array into the specified array in order from first to last element in the deque It is assumed that the array is large enough to hold all elements in the deque
Assigns the specified int value to each element of the specified array of ints

Returns the response body as an InputStream
Copies the specified array truncating or padding with zeros if necessary so the copy has the specified length For all indices that are valid in both the original array and the copy the two arrays will contain identical values For any indices that are valid in the copy but not the original the copy will contain Such indices will exist if and only if the specified length is greater than that of the original array
NoSuchElementException inheritDoc
Returns a link Set view of the mappings contained in this map The set's iterator returns the entries in ascending key order The set is backed by the map so changes to the map are reflected in the set and viceversa If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress except through the iterator's own remove operation or through the setValue operation on a map entry returned by the iterator the results of the iteration are undefined The set supports element removal which removes the corresponding mapping from the map via the Iteratorremove Setremove removeAll retainAll and clear operations It does not support the add or addAll operations
Returns a code Class object that identifies the declared type for the field represented by this code Field object
inheritDoc This implementation iterates over the specified collection and adds each object returned by the iterator to this collection in turn Note that this implementation will throw an UnsupportedOperationException unless add is overridden assuming the specified collection is nonempty
Save the state of the HashMap instance to a stream ie serialize it
Returns sqrtxnbspy without intermediate overflow or underflow Special cases If either argument is infinite then the result is positive infinity If either argument is NaN and neither argument is infinite then the result is NaN The computed result must be within ulp of the exact result If one parameter is held constant the results must be semimonotonic in the other parameter
