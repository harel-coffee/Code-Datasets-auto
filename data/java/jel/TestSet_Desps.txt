Registers a new virtualmachine shutdown hook The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds of events The program exits normally when the last nondaemon thread exits or when the link exit exit equivalently link Systemexitint Systemexit method is invoked or The virtual machine is terminated in response to a user interrupt such as typing ^C or a systemwide event such as user logoff or system shutdown A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted thread When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let them run concurrently When all the hooks have finished it will then run all uninvoked finalizers if finalizationonexit has been enabled Finally the virtual machine will halt Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown sequence as will nondaemon threads if shutdown was initiated by invoking the link exit exit method Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by invoking the link halt halt method which forcibly terminates the virtual machine Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a new shutdown hook or deregister a previouslyregistered hook Attempting either of these operations will cause an link IllegalStateException to be thrown Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual machine and should therefore be coded defensively They should in particular be written to be threadsafe and to avoid deadlocks insofar as possible They should also not rely blindly upon services that may have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in the process of shutting down Attempts to use other threadbased services such as the AWT eventdispatch thread for example may lead to deadlocks Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly When a program invokes link exit exit the expectation is that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit When the virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in which to shut down and exit It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any user interaction or to perform a longrunning computation in a shutdown hook Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any other thread by invoking the link ThreadGroupuncaughtException uncaughtException method of the thread's link ThreadGroup object The default implementation of this method prints the exception's stack trace to link Systemerr and terminates the thread it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or halt In rare circumstances the virtual machine may abort that is stop running without shutting down cleanly This occurs when the virtual machine is terminated externally for example with the SIGKILL signal on Unix or the TerminateProcess call on Microsoft Windows The virtual machine may also abort if a native method goes awry by for example corrupting internal data structures or attempting to access nonexistent memory If the virtual machine aborts then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks will be run

Reads a property list key and element pairs from the input character stream in a simple lineoriented format Properties are processed in terms of lines There are two kinds of line natural lines and logical lines A natural line is defined as a line of characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator characters n or r or rn or by the end of the stream A natural line may be either a blank line a comment line or hold all or some of a keyelement pair A logical line holds all the data of a keyelement pair which may be spread out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping the line terminator sequence with a backslash character Note that a comment line cannot be extended in this manner every natural line that is a comment must have its own comment indicator as described below Lines are read from input until the end of the stream is reached A natural line that contains only white space characters is considered blank and is ignored A comment line has an ASCII '' or '' as its first nonwhite space character comment lines are also ignored and do not encode keyelement information In addition to line terminators this format considers the characters space ' ' 'u' tab 't' 'u' and form feed 'f' 'uC' to be white space If a logical line is spread across several natural lines the backslash escaping the line terminator sequence the line terminator sequence and any white space at the start of the following line have no affect on the key or element values The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing when loading will assume all the characters constituting the key and element appear on a single natural line after line continuation characters have been removed Note that it is not sufficient to only examine the character preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line terminator is escaped there must be an odd number of contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped Since the input is processed from left to right a nonzero even number of n contiguous backslashes before a line terminator or elsewhere encodes n backslashes after escape processing The key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first nonwhite space character and up to but not including the first unescaped '' '' or white space character other than a line terminator All of these key termination characters may be included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash character for example would be the twocharacter key Line terminator characters can be included using r and n escape sequences Any white space after the key is skipped if the first nonwhite space character after the key is '' or '' then it is ignored and any white space characters after it are also skipped All remaining characters on the line become part of the associated element string if there are no remaining characters the element is the empty string quotquot Once the raw character sequences constituting the key and element are identified escape processing is performed as described above As an example each of the following three lines specifies the key Truth and the associated element value Beauty Truth Beauty TruthBeauty Truth Beauty As another example the following three lines specify a single property fruits apple banana pear cantaloupe watermelon kiwi mango The key is fruits and the associated element is apple banana pear cantaloupe watermelon kiwi mango Note that a space appears before each so that a space will appear after each comma in the final result the line terminator and leading white space on the continuation line are merely discarded and are not replaced by one or more other characters As a third example the line cheeses specifies that the key is cheeses and the associated element is the empty string Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape sequences similar to those used for character and string literals see a hrefhttpjavasuncomdocsbooksjlsthird_editionhtmllexicalhtmlsect and a hrefhttpjavasuncomdocsbooksjlsthird_editionhtmllexicalhtmlsect of the Java Language Specification The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode escapes used for characters and strings are Octal escapes are not recognized The character sequence b does not represent a backspace character The method does not treat a backslash character before a nonvalid escape character as an error the backslash is silently dropped For example in a Java string the sequence z would cause a compile time error In contrast this method silently drops the backslash Therefore this method treats the two character sequence b as equivalent to the single character 'b' Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes however by the rule above single and double quote characters preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote characters respectively Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Uniocde escape sequence The specified stream remains open after this method returns
