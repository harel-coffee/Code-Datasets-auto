Writes the specified byte to this output stream The general contract for write is that one byte is written to the output stream The byte to be written is the eight loworder bits of the argument b The highorder bits of b are ignored Subclasses of OutputStream must provide an implementation for this method
Writes blength bytes from the specified byte array to this output stream The general contract for writeb is that it should have exactly the same effect as the call writeb blength
Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to this output stream The general contract for writeb off len is that some of the bytes in the array b are written to the output stream in order element boff is the first byte written and bofflen is the last byte written by this operation The write method of OutputStream calls the write method of one argument on each of the bytes to be written out Subclasses are encouraged to override this method and provide a more efficient implementation If b is null a NullPointerException is thrown If off is negative or len is negative or offlen is greater than the length of the array b then an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown
Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out The general contract of flush is that calling it is an indication that if any bytes previously written have been buffered by the implementation of the output stream such bytes should immediately be written to their intended destination If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by the underlying operating system for example a file then flushing the stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are passed to the operating system for writing it does not guarantee that they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive The flush method of OutputStream does nothing

Returns the canonical string representation of the actions That is this method always returns present actions in the following order read write execute delete For example if this FilePermission object allows both write and read actions a call to getActions will return the string readwrite
Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing FilePermission objects FilePermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them to be inserted into the collection in any order but that also enables the PermissionCollection implies method to be implemented in an efficient and consistent manner For example if you have two FilePermissions tmp read tmpscratchfoo write and you are calling the implies method with the FilePermission tmpscratchfoo readwrite then the implies function must take into account both the tmp and tmpscratchfoo permissions so the effective permission is readwrite and implies returns true The implies semantics for FilePermissions are handled properly by the PermissionCollection object returned by this newPermissionCollection method
WriteObject is called to save the state of the FilePermission to a stream The actions are serialized and the superclass takes care of the name
readObject is called to restore the state of the FilePermission from a stream

Writes the specified byte to the piped output stream Implements the write method of OutputStream
Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to this piped output stream This method blocks until all the bytes are written to the output stream

Fills the input buffer taking the mark into account if it is valid
Reads a single character
Reads characters into a portion of an array reading from the underlying stream if necessary
Reads characters into a portion of an array This method implements the general contract of the corresponding link Readerreadchar int int read method of the link Reader class As an additional convenience it attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking the read method of the underlying stream This iterated read continues until one of the following conditions becomes true The specified number of characters have been read The read method of the underlying stream returns indicating endoffile or The ready method of the underlying stream returns false indicating that further input requests would block If the first read on the underlying stream returns to indicate endoffile then this method returns Otherwise this method returns the number of characters actually read Subclasses of this class are encouraged but not required to attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character buffer filling it from the underlying stream as necessary If however the buffer is empty the mark is not valid and the requested length is at least as large as the buffer then this method will read characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array Thus redundant BufferedReaders will not copy data unnecessarily
Reads a line of text A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed 'n' a carriage return 'r' or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed
Reads a line of text A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed 'n' a carriage return 'r' or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed

Reads the next byte of data from this input stream The value byte is returned as an int in the range to If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached the value is returned This method blocks until input data is available the end of the stream is detected or an exception is thrown The read method of LineNumberInputStream calls the read method of the underlying input stream It checks for carriage returns and newline characters in the input and modifies the current line number as appropriate A carriagereturn character or a carriage return followed by a newline character are both converted into a single newline character
Reads up to len bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes This method blocks until some input is available The read method of LineNumberInputStream repeatedly calls the read method of zero arguments to fill in the byte array
Skips over and discards n bytes of data from this input stream The skip method may for a variety of reasons end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes possibly The actual number of bytes skipped is returned If n is negative no bytes are skipped The skip method of LineNumberInputStream creates a byte array and then repeatedly reads into it until n bytes have been read or the end of the stream has been reached
Sets the line number to the specified argument
Returns the current line number
Returns the number of bytes that can be read from this input stream without blocking Note that if the underlying input stream is able to supply k input characters without blocking the LineNumberInputStream can guarantee only to provide k characters without blocking because the k characters from the underlying input stream might consist of k pairs of 'r' and 'n' which are converted to just k 'n' characters
Marks the current position in this input stream A subsequent call to the reset method repositions this stream at the last marked position so that subsequent reads reread the same bytes The mark method of LineNumberInputStream remembers the current line number in a private variable and then calls the mark method of the underlying input stream
Repositions this stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream The reset method of LineNumberInputStream resets the line number to be the line number at the time the mark method was called and then calls the reset method of the underlying input stream Stream marks are intended to be used in situations where you need to read ahead a little to see what's in the stream Often this is most easily done by invoking some general parser If the stream is of the type handled by the parser it just chugs along happily If the stream is not of that type the parser should toss an exception when it fails which if it happens within readlimit bytes allows the outer code to reset the stream and try another parser

Reads in a string that has been encoded using a modified UTF format The general contract of readUTF is that it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded in modified UTF format this string of characters is then returned as a String First two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned bit integer in exactly the manner of the readUnsignedShort method This integer value is called the UTF length and specifies the number of additional bytes to be read These bytes are then converted to characters by considering them in groups The length of each group is computed from the value of the first byte of the group The byte following a group if any is the first byte of the next group If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern xxxxxxx where x means may be or then the group consists of just that byte The byte is zeroextended to form a character If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern xxxxx then the group consists of that byte a and a second byte b If there is no byte b because byte a was the last of the bytes to be read or if byte b does not match the bit pattern xxxxxx then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown Otherwise the group is converted to the character charaamp xF ltlt | b xF If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern xxxx then the group consists of that byte a and two more bytes b and c If there is no byte c because byte a was one of the last two of the bytes to be read or either byte b or byte c does not match the bit pattern xxxxxx then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown Otherwise the group is converted to the character chara xF ltlt | b xF ltlt | c xF If the first byte of a group matches the pattern xxxx or the pattern xxxxxx then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown If end of file is encountered at any time during this entire process then an EOFException is thrown After every group has been converted to a character by this process the characters are gathered in the same order in which their corresponding groups were read from the input stream to form a String which is returned The writeUTF method of interface DataOutput may be used to write data that is suitable for reading by this method

Specifies that all characters c in the range lownbspltnbspcnbspltnbsphigh are ordinary in this tokenizer See the ordinaryChar method for more information on a character being ordinary
Specifies that the character argument is ordinary in this tokenizer It removes any special significance the character has as a comment character word component string delimiter white space or number character When such a character is encountered by the parser the parser treats it as a singlecharacter token and sets ttype field to the character value Making a line terminator character ordinary may interfere with the ability of a StreamTokenizer to count lines The lineno method may no longer reflect the presence of such terminator characters in its line count
Specified that the character argument starts a singleline comment All characters from the comment character to the end of the line are ignored by this stream tokenizer Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared
Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string constants in this tokenizer When the nextToken method encounters a string constant the ttype field is set to the string delimiter and the sval field is set to the body of the string If a string quote character is encountered then a string is recognized consisting of all characters after but not including the string quote character up to but not including the next occurrence of that same string quote character or a line terminator or end of file The usual escape sequences such as n and t are recognized and converted to single characters as the string is parsed Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared
Specifies that numbers should be parsed by this tokenizer The syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve characters has the numeric attribute When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a double precision floatingpoint number it treats the token as a number rather than a word by setting the ttype field to the value TT_NUMBER and putting the numeric value of the token into the nval field
Determines whether or not ends of line are treated as tokens If the flag argument is true this tokenizer treats end of lines as tokens the nextToken method returns TT_EOL and also sets the ttype field to this value when an end of line is read A line is a sequence of characters ending with either a carriagereturn character 'r' or a newline character 'n' In addition a carriagereturn character followed immediately by a newline character is treated as a single endofline token If the flag is false endofline characters are treated as white space and serve only to separate tokens
Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes Cstyle comments If the flag argument is true this stream tokenizer recognizes Cstyle comments All text between successive occurrences of and are discarded If the flag argument is false then Cstyle comments are not treated specially
Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes Cstyle comments If the flag argument is true this stream tokenizer recognizes Cstyle comments Any occurrence of two consecutive slash characters '' is treated as the beginning of a comment that extends to the end of the line If the flag argument is false then Cstyle comments are not treated specially
Determines whether or not word token are automatically lowercased If the flag argument is true then the value in the sval field is lowercased whenever a word token is returned the ttype field has the value TT_WORD by the nextToken method of this tokenizer If the flag argument is false then the sval field is not modified
Read the next character
Parses the next token from the input stream of this tokenizer The type of the next token is returned in the ttype field Additional information about the token may be in the nval field or the sval field of this tokenizer Typical clients of this class first set up the syntax tables and then sit in a loop calling nextToken to parse successive tokens until TT_EOF is returned

Repositions this stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream The general contract of reset is If the method markSupported returns true then If the method mark has not been called since the stream was created or the number of bytes read from the stream since mark was last called is larger than the argument to mark at that last call then an IOException might be thrown If such an IOException is not thrown then the stream is reset to a state such that all the bytes read since the most recent call to mark or since the start of the file if mark has not been called will be resupplied to subsequent callers of the read method followed by any bytes that otherwise would have been the next input data as of the time of the call to reset If the method markSupported returns false then The call to reset may throw an IOException If an IOException is not thrown then the stream is reset to a fixed state that depends on the particular type of the input stream and how it was created The bytes that will be supplied to subsequent callers of the read method depend on the particular type of the input stream The method reset for class InputStream does nothing except throw an IOException
Tests if this input stream supports the mark and reset methods Whether or not mark and reset are supported is an invariant property of a particular input stream instance The markSupported method of InputStream returns false
Flush the internal buffer
Writes the specified byte to this buffered output stream
Writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to this buffered output stream Ordinarily this method stores bytes from the given array into this stream's buffer flushing the buffer to the underlying output stream as needed If the requested length is at least as large as this stream's buffer however then this method will flush the buffer and write the bytes directly to the underlying output stream Thus redundant BufferedOutputStreams will not copy data unnecessarily
Flushes this buffered output stream This forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the underlying output stream
Returns the name of the character encoding being used by this stream If the encoding has an historical name then that name is returned otherwise the encoding's canonical name is returned If this instance was created with the link InputStreamReaderInputStream String constructor then the returned name being unique for the encoding may differ from the name passed to the constructor This method will return null if the stream has been closed 
Reads a single character
Reads characters into a portion of an array
Tells whether this stream is ready to be read An InputStreamReader is ready if its input buffer is not empty or if bytes are available to be read from the underlying byte stream
Causes this piped input stream to be connected to the piped output stream src If this object is already connected to some other piped output stream an IOException is thrown If src is an unconnected piped output stream and snk is an unconnected piped input stream they may be connected by either the call snkconnectsrc or the call srcconnectsnk The two calls have the same effect
Receives a byte of data This method will block if no input is available
Receives data into an array of bytes This method will block until some input is available
Notifies all waiting threads that the last byte of data has been received
Reads the next byte of data from this piped input stream The value byte is returned as an int in the range to This method blocks until input data is available the end of the stream is detected or an exception is thrown
Reads up to len bytes of data from this piped input stream into an array of bytes Less than len bytes will be read if the end of the data stream is reached or if len exceeds the pipe's buffer size If len is zero then no bytes are read and is returned otherwise the method blocks until at least byte of input is available end of the stream has been detected or an exception is thrown
Returns the number of bytes that can be read from this input stream without blocking
Closes this piped input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream

Appends the specified character sequence to this writer An invocation of this method of the form outappendcsq behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation outwritecsqtoString Depending on the specification of toString for the character sequence csq the entire sequence may not be appended For instance invoking the toString method of a character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon the buffer's position and limit
Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this writer An invocation of this method of the form outappendcsq start end when csq is not null behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation outwritecsqsubSequencestart endtoString

Closing a StringWriter has no effect The methods in this class can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an IOException
Check to make sure that this stream has not been closed
Reads the next byte of data from this input stream The value byte is returned as an int in the range to If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached the value is returned This method blocks until input data is available the end of the stream is detected or an exception is thrown This method returns the most recently pushedback byte if there is one and otherwise calls the read method of its underlying input stream and returns whatever value that method returns
Reads up to len bytes of data from this input stream into an array of bytes This method first reads any pushedback bytes after that if fewer than len bytes have been read then it reads from the underlying input stream If len is not zero the method blocks until at least byte of input is available otherwise no bytes are read and is returned
Pushes back a byte by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer After this method returns the next byte to be read will have the value byteb
Pushes back a portion of an array of bytes by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer After this method returns the next byte to be read will have the value boff the byte after that will have the value boff and so forth
Pushes back an array of bytes by copying it to the front of the pushback buffer After this method returns the next byte to be read will have the value b the byte after that will have the value b and so forth
Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read or skipped over from this input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream The next invocation might be the same thread or another thread A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block but may read or skip fewer bytes The method returns the sum of the number of bytes that have been pushed back and the value returned by link javaioFilterInputStreamavailable available
Skips over and discards n bytes of data from this input stream The skip method may for a variety of reasons end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes possibly zero If n is negative no bytes are skipped The skip method of PushbackInputStream first skips over the bytes in the pushback buffer if any It then calls the skip method of the underlying input stream if more bytes need to be skipped The actual number of bytes skipped is returned
Tests if this input stream supports the mark and reset methods which it does not
Marks the current position in this input stream The mark method of PushbackInputStream does nothing
Repositions this stream to the position at the time the mark method was last called on this input stream The method reset for class PushbackInputStream does nothing except throw an IOException
Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream Once the stream has been closed further read unread available reset or skip invocations will throw an IOException Closing a previously closed stream has no effect
Specify stream protocol version to use when writing the stream This routine provides a hook to enable the current version of Serialization to write in a format that is backwards compatible to a previous version of the stream format Every effort will be made to avoid introducing additional backwards incompatibilities however sometimes there is no other alternative
Write the specified object to the ObjectOutputStream The class of the object the signature of the class and the values of the nontransient and nonstatic fields of the class and all of its supertypes are written Default serialization for a class can be overridden using the writeObject and the readObject methods Objects referenced by this object are written transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects can be reconstructed by an ObjectInputStream Exceptions are thrown for problems with the OutputStream and for classes that should not be serialized All exceptions are fatal to the OutputStream which is left in an indeterminate state and it is up to the caller to ignore or recover the stream state
Method used by subclasses to override the default writeObject method This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectInputStream that constructed ObjectInputStream using the protected noarg constructor The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier final
Writes an unshared object to the ObjectOutputStream This method is identical to writeObject except that it always writes the given object as a new unique object in the stream as opposed to a backreference pointing to a previously serialized instance Specifically An object written via writeUnshared is always serialized in the same manner as a newly appearing object an object that has not been written to the stream yet regardless of whether or not the object has been written previously If writeObject is used to write an object that has been previously written with writeUnshared the previous writeUnshared operation is treated as if it were a write of a separate object In other words ObjectOutputStream will never generate backreferences to object data written by calls to writeUnshared While writing an object via writeUnshared does not in itself guarantee a unique reference to the object when it is deserialized it allows a single object to be defined multiple times in a stream so that multiple calls to readUnshared by the receiver will not conflict Note that the rules described above only apply to the baselevel object written with writeUnshared and not to any transitively referenced subobjects in the object graph to be serialized ObjectOutputStream subclasses which override this method can only be constructed in security contexts possessing the enableSubclassImplementation SerializablePermission any attempt to instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a SecurityException to be thrown
Write the nonstatic and nontransient fields of the current class to this stream This may only be called from the writeObject method of the class being serialized It will throw the NotActiveException if it is called otherwise
Retrieve the object used to buffer persistent fields to be written to the stream The fields will be written to the stream when writeFields method is called

Reset will disregard the state of any objects already written to the stream The state is reset to be the same as a new ObjectOutputStream The current point in the stream is marked as reset so the corresponding ObjectInputStream will be reset at the same point Objects previously written to the stream will not be refered to as already being in the stream They will be written to the stream again
Subclasses may implement this method to allow class data to be stored in the stream By default this method does nothing The corresponding method in ObjectInputStream is resolveClass This method is called exactly once for each unique class in the stream The class name and signature will have already been written to the stream This method may make free use of the ObjectOutputStream to save any representation of the class it deems suitable for example the bytes of the class file The resolveClass method in the corresponding subclass of ObjectInputStream must read and use any data or objects written by annotateClass
Subclasses may implement this method to store custom data in the stream along with descriptors for dynamic proxy classes This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class descriptor in the stream The default implementation of this method in ObjectOutputStream does nothing The corresponding method in ObjectInputStream is resolveProxyClass For a given subclass of ObjectOutputStream that overrides this method the resolveProxyClass method in the corresponding subclass of ObjectInputStream must read any data or objects written by annotateProxyClass
This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectOutputStream to substitute one object for another during serialization Replacing objects is disabled until enableReplaceObject is called The enableReplaceObject method checks that the stream requesting to do replacement can be trusted The first occurrence of each object written into the serialization stream is passed to replaceObject Subsequent references to the object are replaced by the object returned by the original call to replaceObject To ensure that the private state of objects is not unintentionally exposed only trusted streams may use replaceObject The ObjectOutputStreamwriteObject method takes a parameter of type Object as opposed to type Serializable to allow for cases where nonserializable objects are replaced by serializable ones When a subclass is replacing objects it must insure that either a complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that the substituted object is compatible with every field where the reference will be stored Objects whose type is not a subclass of the type of the field or array element abort the serialization by raising an exception and the object is not be stored This method is called only once when each object is first encountered All subsequent references to the object will be redirected to the new object This method should return the object to be substituted or the original object Null can be returned as the object to be substituted but may cause NullReferenceException in classes that contain references to the original object since they may be expecting an object instead of null
Enable the stream to do replacement of objects in the stream When enabled the replaceObject method is called for every object being serialized If enable is true and there is a security manager installed this method first calls the security manager's checkPermission method with a SerializablePermissionenableSubstitution permission to ensure it's ok to enable the stream to do replacement of objects in the stream
The writeStreamHeader method is provided so subclasses can append or prepend their own header to the stream It writes the magic number and version to the stream
Write the specified class descriptor to the ObjectOutputStream Class descriptors are used to identify the classes of objects written to the stream Subclasses of ObjectOutputStream may override this method to customize the way in which class descriptors are written to the serialization stream The corresponding method in ObjectInputStream readClassDescriptor should then be overridden to reconstitute the class descriptor from its custom stream representation By default this method writes class descriptors according to the format defined in the Object Serialization specification Note that this method will only be called if the ObjectOutputStream is not using the old serialization stream format set by calling ObjectOutputStream's useProtocolVersion method If this serialization stream is using the old format PROTOCOL_VERSION_ the class descriptor will be written internally in a manner that cannot be overridden or customized

This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectOutputStream that constructed ObjectOutputStream using the protected noarg constructor The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier final
Reads an unshared object from the ObjectInputStream This method is identical to readObject except that it prevents subsequent calls to readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the deserialized instance obtained via this call Specifically If readUnshared is called to deserialize a backreference the stream representation of an object which has been written previously to the stream an ObjectStreamException will be thrown If readUnshared returns successfully then any subsequent attempts to deserialize backreferences to the stream handle deserialized by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle associated with the returned object Note that this in itself does not always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an object visible to other parties or readUnshared may return a Class object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through external means If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method and the invocation of that method returns an array then readUnshared returns a shallow clone of that array this guarantees that the returned array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated ObjectInputStream subclasses which override this method can only be constructed in security contexts possessing the enableSubclassImplementation SerializablePermission any attempt to instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a SecurityException to be thrown

Sets the lastmodified time of the file or directory named by this abstract pathname All platforms support filemodification times to the nearest second but some provide more precision The argument will be truncated to fit the supported precision If the operation succeeds and no intervening operations on the file take place then the next invocation of the link lastModified method will return the possibly truncated time argument that was passed to this method
Marks the file or directory named by this abstract pathname so that only read operations are allowed After invoking this method the file or directory is guaranteed not to change until it is either deleted or marked to allow write access Whether or not a readonly file or directory may be deleted depends upon the underlying system

List the available filesystem roots A particular Java platform may support zero or more hierarchicallyorganized file systems Each file system has a code root directory from which all other files in that file system can be reached Windows platforms for example have a root directory for each active drive UNIX platforms have a single root directory namely code The set of available filesystem roots is affected by various systemlevel operations such as the insertion or ejection of removable media and the disconnecting or unmounting of physical or virtual disk drives This method returns an array of code File objects that denote the root directories of the available filesystem roots It is guaranteed that the canonical pathname of any file physically present on the local machine will begin with one of the roots returned by this method The canonical pathname of a file that resides on some other machine and is accessed via a remotefilesystem protocol such as SMB or NFS may or may not begin with one of the roots returned by this method If the pathname of a remote file is syntactically indistinguishable from the pathname of a local file then it will begin with one of the roots returned by this method Thus for example code File objects denoting the root directories of the mapped network drives of a Windows platform will be returned by this method while code File objects containing UNC pathnames will not be returned by this method Unlike most methods in this class this method does not throw security exceptions If a security manager exists and its link SecurityManagercheckReadString method denies read access to a particular root directory then that directory will not appear in the result

Returns the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the partition named by this abstract pathname When possible this method checks for write permissions and other operating system restrictions and will therefore usually provide a more accurate estimate of how much new data can actually be written than link getFreeSpace The returned number of available bytes is a hint but not a guarantee that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes The number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately after this call It is likely to be made inaccurate by any external IO operations including those made on the system outside of this virtual machine This method makes no guarantee that write operations to this file system will succeed
 Creates a new empty file in the specified directory using the given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name If this method returns successfully then it is guaranteed that The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist before this method was invoked and Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual machine This method provides only part of a temporaryfile facility To arrange for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically use the link deleteOnExit method The prefix argument must be at least three characters long It is recommended that the prefix be a short meaningful string such as hjb or mail The suffix argument may be null in which case the suffix tmp will be used To create the new file the prefix and the suffix may first be adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform If the prefix is too long then it will be truncated but its first three characters will always be preserved If the suffix is too long then it too will be truncated but if it begins with a period character '' then the period and the first three characters following it will always be preserved Once these adjustments have been made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the prefix five or more internallygenerated characters and the suffix If the directory argument is null then the systemdependent default temporaryfile directory will be used The default temporaryfile directory is specified by the system property javaiotmpdir On UNIX systems the default value of this property is typically tmp or vartmp on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically CWINNTTEMP A different value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine is invoked but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method

Creates a URI by parsing the given string This convenience factory method works as if by invoking the link URIString constructor any link URISyntaxException thrown by the constructor is caught and wrapped in a new link IllegalArgumentException object which is then thrown This method is provided for use in situations where it is known that the given string is a legal URI for example for URI constants declared within in a program and so it would be considered a programming error for the string not to parse as such The constructors which throw link URISyntaxException directly should be used situations where a URI is being constructed from user input or from some other source that may be prone to errors 
Attempts to parse this URI's authority component if defined into userinformation host and port components If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as being serverbased then it will already have been parsed into userinformation host and port components In this case or if this URI has no authority component this method simply returns this URI Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority component into userinformation host and port components and throws an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed in that way This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in RFCnbsp cannot always distinguish a malformed serverbased authority from a legitimate registrybased authority It must therefore treat some instances of the former as instances of the latter The authority component in the URI string foobar for example is not a legal serverbased authority but it is legal as a registrybased authority In many common situations for example when working URIs that are known to be either URNs or URLs the hierarchical URIs being used will always be serverbased They therefore must either be parsed as such or treated as an error In these cases a statement such as URI u new URIstrparseServerAuthority can be used to ensure that u always refers to a URI that if it has an authority component has a serverbased authority with proper userinformation host and port components Invoking this method also ensures that if the authority could not be parsed in that way then an appropriate diagnostic message can be issued based upon the exception that is thrown

Relativizes the given URI against this URI The relativization of the given URI against this URI is computed as follows If either this URI or the given URI are opaque or if the scheme and authority components of the two URIs are not identical or if the path of this URI is not a prefix of the path of the given URI then the given URI is returned Otherwise a new relative hierarchical URI is constructed with query and fragment components taken from the given URI and with a path component computed by removing this URI's path from the beginning of the given URI's path 
Constructs a URL from this URI This convenience method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the expression newnbspURLthistoString after first checking that this URI is absolute 
Returns the scheme component of this URI The scheme component of a URI if defined only contains characters in the alphanum category and in the string A scheme always starts with an alpha character The scheme component of a URI cannot contain escaped octets hence this method does not perform any decoding

Returns a hashcode value for this URI The hash code is based upon all of the URI's components and satisfies the general contract of the link javalangObjecthashCode ObjecthashCode method
Compares this URI to another object which must be a URI When comparing corresponding components of two URIs if one component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is considered to be less than the second Unless otherwise noted string components are ordered according to their natural casesensitive ordering as defined by the link javalangStringcompareToObject StringcompareTo method String components that are subject to encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their encoded forms The ordering of URIs is defined as follows Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the ordering of their schemes without regard to case A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI with an identical scheme Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according to the ordering of their schemespecific parts Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and schemespecific parts are ordered according to the ordering of their fragments Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered according to the ordering of their authority components If both authority components are serverbased then the URIs are ordered according to their userinformation components if these components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their hosts without regard to case if the hosts are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their ports If one or both authority components are registrybased then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority components Finally two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes and authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their paths if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to the ordering of their queries if the queries are identical then they are ordered according to the order of their fragments This method satisfies the general contract of the link javalangComparablecompareToObject ComparablecompareTo method

Retrieve setting for SO_TIMEOUT returns implies that the option is disabled ie timeout of infinity
Sets the SO_SNDBUF option to the specified value for this DatagramSocket The SO_SNDBUF option is used by the network implementation as a hint to size the underlying network IO buffers The SO_SNDBUF setting may also be used by the network implementation to determine the maximum size of the packet that can be sent on this socket As SO_SNDBUF is a hint applications that want to verify what size the buffer is should call link getSendBufferSize Increasing the buffer size may allow multiple outgoing packets to be queued by the network implementation when the send rate is high Note If link sendDatagramPacket is used to send a DatagramPacket that is larger than the setting of SO_SNDBUF then it is implementation specific if the packet is sent or discarded
Get value of the SO_SNDBUF option for this DatagramSocket that is the buffer size used by the platform for output on this DatagramSocket
Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the specified value for this DatagramSocket The SO_RCVBUF option is used by the the network implementation as a hint to size the underlying network IO buffers The SO_RCVBUF setting may also be used by the network implementation to determine the maximum size of the packet that can be received on this socket Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to should call link getReceiveBufferSize Increasing SO_RCVBUF may allow the network implementation to buffer multiple packets when packets arrive faster than are being received using link receiveDatagramPacket Note It is implementation specific if a packet larger than SO_RCVBUF can be received
Get value of the SO_RCVBUF option for this DatagramSocket that is the buffer size used by the platform for input on this DatagramSocket
Enabledisable the SO_REUSEADDR socket option For UDP sockets it may be necessary to bind more than one socket to the same socket address This is typically for the purpose of receiving multicast packets See link javanetMulticastSocket The SO_REUSEADDR socket option allows multiple sockets to be bound to the same socket address if the SO_REUSEADDR socket option is enabled prior to binding the socket using link bindSocketAddress Note This functionality is not supported by all existing platforms so it is implementation specific whether this option will be ignored or not However if it is not supported then link getReuseAddress will always return false When a DatagramSocket is created the initial setting of SO_REUSEADDR is disabled The behaviour when SO_REUSEADDR is enabled or disabled after a socket is bound See link isBound is not defined
Tests if SO_REUSEADDR is enabled
Enabledisable SO_BROADCAST
Tests if SO_BROADCAST is enabled

Return the discard attribute of the cookie
Specify the portlist of the cookie which restricts the ports to which a cookie may be sent back in a Cookie header
Return the port list attribute of the cookie
Specifies the domain within which this cookie should be presented The form of the domain name is specified by RFC A domain name begins with a dot foocom and means that the cookie is visible to servers in a specified Domain Name System DNS zone for example wwwfoocom but not abfoocom By default cookies are only returned to the server that sent them
Returns the domain name set for this cookie The form of the domain name is set by RFC 
Sets the maximum age of the cookie in seconds A positive value indicates that the cookie will expire after that many seconds have passed Note that the value is the maximum age when the cookie will expire not the cookie's current age A negative value means that the cookie is not stored persistently and will be deleted when the Web browser exits A zero value causes the cookie to be deleted
Returns the maximum age of the cookie specified in seconds By default indicating the cookie will persist until browser shutdown
Specifies a path for the cookie to which the client should return the cookie The cookie is visible to all the pages in the directory you specify and all the pages in that directory's subdirectories A cookie's path must include the servlet that set the cookie for example catalog which makes the cookie visible to all directories on the server under catalog Consult RFC available on the Internet for more information on setting path names for cookies
Returns the path on the server to which the browser returns this cookie The cookie is visible to all subpaths on the server
Indicates to the browser whether the cookie should only be sent using a secure protocol such as HTTPS or SSL The default value is false
Returns true if the browser is sending cookies only over a secure protocol or false if the browser can send cookies using any protocol
Returns the name of the cookie The name cannot be changed after creation
Assigns a new value to a cookie after the cookie is created If you use a binary value you may want to use BASE encoding With Version cookies values should not contain white space brackets parentheses equals signs commas double quotes slashes question marks at signs colons and semicolons Empty values may not behave the same way on all browsers

Sets the format to use for the format elements within the previously set pattern string that use the given argument index The argument index is part of the format element definition and represents an index into the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods If the argument index is used for more than one format element in the pattern string then the new format is used for all such format elements If the argument index is not used for any format element in the pattern string then the new format is ignored
Sets the format to use for the format element with the given format element index within the previously set pattern string The format element index is the zerobased number of the format element counting from the start of the pattern string Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often changes during localization it is generally better to use the link setFormatByArgumentIndex setFormatByArgumentIndex method which accesses format elements based on the argument index they specify
Gets the formats used for the values passed into format methods or returned from parse methods The indices of elements in the returned array correspond to the argument indices used in the previously set pattern string The order of formats in the returned array thus corresponds to the order of elements in the arguments array passed to the format methods or the result array returned by the parse methods If an argument index is used for more than one format element in the pattern string then the format used for the last such format element is returned in the array If an argument index is not used for any format element in the pattern string then null is returned in the array

Formats an array of objects and inserts them into the MessageFormat's pattern producing an AttributedCharacterIterator You can use the returned AttributedCharacterIterator to build the resulting String as well as to determine information about the resulting String The text of the returned AttributedCharacterIterator is the same that would be returned by link formatjavalangObject javalangStringBuffer javatextFieldPosition formatarguments new StringBuffer nulltoString In addition the AttributedCharacterIterator contains at least attributes indicating where text was generated from an argument in the arguments array The keys of these attributes are of type MessageFormatField their values are Integer objects indicating the index in the arguments array of the argument from which the text was generated The attributesvalue from the underlying Format instances that MessageFormat uses will also be placed in the resulting AttributedCharacterIterator This allows you to not only find where an argument is placed in the resulting String but also which fields it contains in turn
Parses the string Caveats The parse may fail in a number of circumstances For example If one of the arguments does not occur in the pattern If the format of an argument loses information such as with a choice format where a large number formats to many Does not yet handle recursion where the substituted strings contain n references Will not always find a match or the correct match if some part of the parse is ambiguous For example if the pattern is used with the string arguments ab c it will format as abc When the result is parsed it will return a bc If a single argument is parsed more than once in the string then the later parse wins When the parse fails use ParsePositiongetErrorIndex to find out where in the string the parsing failed The returned error index is the starting offset of the subpatterns that the string is comparing with For example if the parsing string AAA BBB is comparing against the pattern AAD BBB the error index is When an error occurs the call to this method will return null If the source is null return an empty array
Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce an object array The method may not use the entire text of the given string See the link parseString ParsePosition method for more information on message parsing
Parses text from a string to produce an object array The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by pos If parsing succeeds then the index of pos is updated to the index after the last character used parsing does not necessarily use all characters up to the end of the string and the parsed object array is returned The updated pos can be used to indicate the starting point for the next call to this method If an error occurs then the index of pos is not changed the error index of pos is set to the index of the character where the error occurred and null is returned See the link parseString ParsePosition method for more information on message parsing

Resets the cursor to the beginning of the string The next call to next will return the first collation element in the string
Get the next collation element in the string This iterator iterates over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string Because there isn't necessarily a onetoone mapping from characters to collation elements this doesn't mean the same thing as return the collation element or ordering priority of the next character in the string This function returns the collation element that the iterator is currently pointing to and then updates the internal pointer to point to the next element previous updates the pointer first and then returns the element This means that when you change direction while iterating ie call next and then call previous or call previous and then call next you'll get back the same element twice
Get the previous collation element in the string This iterator iterates over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string Because there isn't necessarily a onetoone mapping from characters to collation elements this doesn't mean the same thing as return the collation element or ordering priority of the previous character in the string This function updates the iterator's internal pointer to point to the collation element preceding the one it's currently pointing to and then returns that element while next returns the current element and then updates the pointer This means that when you change direction while iterating ie call next and then call previous or call previous and then call next you'll get back the same element twice

Sets the iterator to point to the collation element corresponding to the specified character the parameter is a CHARACTER offset in the original string not an offset into its corresponding sequence of collation elements The value returned by the next call to next will be the collation element corresponding to the specified position in the text If that position is in the middle of a contracting character sequence the result of the next call to next is the collation element for that sequence This means that getOffset is not guaranteed to return the same value as was passed to a preceding call to setOffset
Returns the character offset in the original text corresponding to the next collation element That is getOffset returns the position in the text corresponding to the collation element that will be returned by the next call to next This value will always be the index of the FIRST character corresponding to the collation element a contracting character sequence is when two or more characters all correspond to the same collation element This means if you do setOffsetx followed immediately by getOffset getOffset won't necessarily return x

Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce a date The method may not use the entire text of the given string See the link parseString ParsePosition method for more information on date parsing
Parse a datetime string according to the given parse position For example a time text PM PDT will be parsed into a Date that is equivalent to Date By default parsing is lenient If the input is not in the form used by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date then the parse succeeds Clients may insist on strict adherence to the format by calling setLenientfalse
Parses text from a string to produce a Date The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by pos If parsing succeeds then the index of pos is updated to the index after the last character used parsing does not necessarily use all characters up to the end of the string and the parsed date is returned The updated pos can be used to indicate the starting point for the next call to this method If an error occurs then the index of pos is not changed the error index of pos is set to the index of the character where the error occurred and null is returned See the link parseString ParsePosition method for more information on date parsing

Create a tablebased collation object with the given rules This is the main function that actually builds the tables and stores them back in the RBCollationTables object It is called ONLY by the RBCollationTables constructor
Add expanding entries for precomposed unicode characters so that this collator can be used reasonably well with decomposition turned off
Look up for unmapped values in the expanded character table When the expanding character tables are built by addExpandOrder it doesn't know what the final ordering of each character in the expansion will be Instead it just puts the raw character code into the table adding CHARINDEX as a flag Now that we've finished building the mapping table we can go back and look up that character to see what its real collation order is and stick that into the expansion table That lets us avoid doing a twostage lookup later

Reads a property list key and element pairs from the input character stream in a simple lineoriented format Properties are processed in terms of lines There are two kinds of line natural lines and logical lines A natural line is defined as a line of characters that is terminated either by a set of line terminator characters n or r or rn or by the end of the stream A natural line may be either a blank line a comment line or hold all or some of a keyelement pair A logical line holds all the data of a keyelement pair which may be spread out across several adjacent natural lines by escaping the line terminator sequence with a backslash character Note that a comment line cannot be extended in this manner every natural line that is a comment must have its own comment indicator as described below Lines are read from input until the end of the stream is reached A natural line that contains only white space characters is considered blank and is ignored A comment line has an ASCII '' or '' as its first nonwhite space character comment lines are also ignored and do not encode keyelement information In addition to line terminators this format considers the characters space ' ' 'u' tab 't' 'u' and form feed 'f' 'uC' to be white space If a logical line is spread across several natural lines the backslash escaping the line terminator sequence the line terminator sequence and any white space at the start of the following line have no affect on the key or element values The remainder of the discussion of key and element parsing when loading will assume all the characters constituting the key and element appear on a single natural line after line continuation characters have been removed Note that it is not sufficient to only examine the character preceding a line terminator sequence to decide if the line terminator is escaped there must be an odd number of contiguous backslashes for the line terminator to be escaped Since the input is processed from left to right a nonzero even number of n contiguous backslashes before a line terminator or elsewhere encodes n backslashes after escape processing The key contains all of the characters in the line starting with the first nonwhite space character and up to but not including the first unescaped '' '' or white space character other than a line terminator All of these key termination characters may be included in the key by escaping them with a preceding backslash character for example would be the twocharacter key Line terminator characters can be included using r and n escape sequences Any white space after the key is skipped if the first nonwhite space character after the key is '' or '' then it is ignored and any white space characters after it are also skipped All remaining characters on the line become part of the associated element string if there are no remaining characters the element is the empty string quotquot Once the raw character sequences constituting the key and element are identified escape processing is performed as described above As an example each of the following three lines specifies the key Truth and the associated element value Beauty Truth Beauty TruthBeauty Truth Beauty As another example the following three lines specify a single property fruits apple banana pear cantaloupe watermelon kiwi mango The key is fruits and the associated element is apple banana pear cantaloupe watermelon kiwi mango Note that a space appears before each so that a space will appear after each comma in the final result the line terminator and leading white space on the continuation line are merely discarded and are not replaced by one or more other characters As a third example the line cheeses specifies that the key is cheeses and the associated element is the empty string Characters in keys and elements can be represented in escape sequences similar to those used for character and string literals see a hrefhttpjavasuncomdocsbooksjlsthird_editionhtmllexicalhtmlsect and a hrefhttpjavasuncomdocsbooksjlsthird_editionhtmllexicalhtmlsect of the Java Language Specification The differences from the character escape sequences and Unicode escapes used for characters and strings are Octal escapes are not recognized The character sequence b does not represent a backspace character The method does not treat a backslash character before a nonvalid escape character as an error the backslash is silently dropped For example in a Java string the sequence z would cause a compile time error In contrast this method silently drops the backslash Therefore this method treats the two character sequence b as equivalent to the single character 'b' Escapes are not necessary for single and double quotes however by the rule above single and double quote characters preceded by a backslash still yield single and double quote characters respectively Only a single 'u' character is allowed in a Uniocde escape sequence The specified stream remains open after this method returns
Reads a property list key and element pairs from the input byte stream The input stream is in a simple lineoriented format as specified in link loadjavaioReader loadReader and is assumed to use the ISO character encoding that is each byte is one Latin character Characters not in Latin and certain special characters are represented in keys and elements using Unicode escapes The specified stream remains open after this method returns

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set The elements are returned in no particular order unless this set is an instance of some class that provides a guarantee
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator this method must return the elements in the same order The returned array will be safe in that no references to it are maintained by this set In other words this method must allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array The caller is thus free to modify the returned array This method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array If the set fits in the specified array it is returned therein Otherwise a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this set If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare ie the array has more elements than this set the element in the array immediately following the end of the set is set to null This is useful in determining the length of this set only if the caller knows that this set does not contain any null elements If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator this method must return the elements in the same order Like the link toArray method this method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs Further this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array and may under certain circumstances be used to save allocation costs Suppose x is a set known to contain only strings The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated array of String String y xtoArraynew String Note that toArraynew Object is identical in function to toArray
Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present optional operation More formally adds the specified element e to this set if the set contains no element e such that enullnbspnbspenullnbspnbspeequalse If this set already contains the element the call leaves the set unchanged and returns false In combination with the restriction on constructors this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all elements sets may refuse to add any particular element including null and throw an exception as described in the specification for link Collectionadd Collectionadd Individual set implementations should clearly document any restrictions on the elements that they may contain

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if they're not already present optional operation If the specified collection is also a set the addAll operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the union of the two sets The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress
Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the specified collection optional operation In other words removes from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection If the specified collection is also a set this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the intersection of the two sets
Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection optional operation If the specified collection is also a set this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the asymmetric set difference of the two sets

Returns a shallow copy of this ArrayList instance The elements themselves are not copied
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence from first to last element The returned array will be safe in that no references to it are maintained by this list In other words this method must allocate a new array The caller is thus free to modify the returned array This method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence from first to last element the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array If the list fits in the specified array it is returned therein Otherwise a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this list If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare ie the array has more elements than the list the element in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to null This is useful in determining the length of the list only if the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements
Returns the element at the specified position in this list
Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element
Appends the specified element to the end of this list
Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list Shifts the element currently at that position if any and any subsequent elements to the right adds one to their indices
Removes the element at the specified position in this list Shifts any subsequent elements to the left subtracts one from their indices
Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list if it is present If the list does not contain the element it is unchanged More formally removes the element with the lowest index i such that onullnbspnbspgetinullnbspnbspoequalsgeti if such an element exists Returns true if this list contained the specified element or equivalently if this list changed as a result of the call
Removes all of the elements from this list The list will be empty after this call returns
Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's Iterator The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this list and this list is nonempty
Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list starting at the specified position Shifts the element currently at that position if any and any subsequent elements to the right increases their indices The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator
Removes from this list all of the elements whose index is between code fromIndex inclusive and code toIndex exclusive Shifts any succeeding elements to the left reduces their index This call shortens the list by code toIndex fromIndex elements If code toIndexfromIndex this operation has no effect
Checks if the given index is in range If not throws an appropriate runtime exception This method does not check if the index is negative It is always used immediately prior to an array access which throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if index is negative

Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence The returned iterator is failfast
Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified code fromIndex inclusive and code toIndex exclusive If code fromIndex and code toIndex are equal the returned list is empty The returned list is backed by this list so nonstructural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list and viceversa The returned list supports all of the optional list operations This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations of the sort that commonly exist for arrays Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list For example the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list listsubListfrom toclear Similar idioms may be constructed for link indexOfObject and link lastIndexOfObject and all of the algorithms in the link Collections class can be applied to a subList The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list ie this list is structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list Structural modifications are those that change the size of this list or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results

Returns the set of flags which contains a duplicate flag
Compares its two arguments for order Returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as the first argument is less than equal to or greater than the second In the foregoing description the notation sgnexpression designates the mathematical signum function which is defined to return one of or according to whether the value of expression is negative zero or positive The implementor must ensure that sgncomparex y sgncomparey x for all x and y This implies that comparex y must throw an exception if and only if comparey x throws an exception The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive comparex ygt ampamp comparey zgt implies comparex zgt Finally the implementor must ensure that comparex y implies that sgncomparex zsgncomparey z for all z It is generally the case but not strictly required that comparex y xequalsy Generally speaking any comparator that violates this condition should clearly indicate this fact The recommended language is Note this comparator imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals
Indicates whether some other object is quotequal toquot this comparator This method must obey the general contract of link ObjectequalsObject Additionally this method can return true only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as this comparator Thus compequalscomp implies that sgncompcompareo osgncompcompareo o for every object reference o and o Note that it is always safe not to override ObjectequalsObject However overriding this method may in some cases improve performance by allowing programs to determine that two distinct comparators impose the same order
Returns the number of keyvalue mappings in this map
Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key
Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value More formally returns true if and only if this map contains at least one mapping to a value v such that valuenull vnull valueequalsv This operation will probably require time linear in the map size for most implementations
Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped or code null if this map contains no mapping for the key More formally if this map contains a mapping from a key code k to a value code v such that code key compares equal to code k according to the map's ordering then this method returns code v otherwise it returns code null There can be at most one such mapping A return value of code null does not necessarily indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key it's also possible that the map explicitly maps the key to code null The link containsKey containsKey operation may be used to distinguish these two cases

Formats the object using the provided link Formatter formatter
The error method is called when a Handler failure occurs This method may be overriden in subclasses The default behavior in this base class is that the first call is reported to Systemerr and subsequent calls are ignored
Publish a LogRecord The logging request was made initially to a Logger object which initialized the LogRecord and forwarded it here The Handler is responsible for formatting the message when and if necessary The formatting should include localization
Flush any buffered output
Close the Handler and free all associated resources The close method will perform a flush and then close the Handler After close has been called this Handler should no longer be used Method calls may either be silently ignored or may throw runtime exceptions
Set a Formatter This Formatter will be used to format LogRecords for this Handler Some Handlers may not use Formatters in which case the Formatter will be remembered but not used 
Return the Formatter for this Handler
Set the character encoding used by this Handler The encoding should be set before any LogRecords are written to the Handler
Return the character encoding for this Handler
Set a Filter to control output on this Handler For each call of publish the Handler will call this Filter if it is nonnull to check if the LogRecord should be published or discarded
Get the current Filter for this Handler
Define an ErrorManager for this Handler The ErrorManager's error method will be invoked if any errors occur while using this Handler
Retrieves the ErrorManager for this Handler
Protected convenience method to report an error to this Handler's ErrorManager Note that this method retrieves and uses the ErrorManager without doing a security check It can therefore be used in environments where the caller may be nonprivileged
Set the log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this Handler Message levels lower than this value will be discarded The intention is to allow developers to turn on voluminous logging but to limit the messages that are sent to certain Handlers
Get the log level specifying which messages will be logged by this Handler Message levels lower than this level will be discarded
Check if this Handler would actually log a given LogRecord This method checks if the LogRecord has an appropriate Level and whether it satisfies any Filter It also may make other Handler specific checks that might prevent a handler from logging the LogRecord It will return false if the LogRecord is Null 
Store a LogRecord in an internal buffer If there is a Filter its isLoggable method is called to check if the given log record is loggable If not we return Otherwise the given record is copied into an internal circular buffer Then the record's level property is compared with the pushLevel If the given level is greater than or equal to the pushLevel then push is called to write all buffered records to the target output Handler
Push any buffered output to the target Handler The buffer is then cleared
Causes a flush on the target Handler Note that the current contents of the MemoryHandler buffer are not written out That requires a push
Close the Handler and free all associated resources This will also close the target Handler
Set the pushLevel After a LogRecord is copied into our internal buffer if its level is greater than or equal to the pushLevel then push will be called
Get the pushLevel
Check if this Handler would actually log a given LogRecord into its internal buffer This method checks if the LogRecord has an appropriate level and whether it satisfies any Filter However it does not check whether the LogRecord would result in a push of the buffer contents It will return false if the LogRecord is Null 
Check if a given log record should be published
Format the given message to XML This method can be overridden in a subclass It is recommended to use the link FormatterformatMessage convenience method to localize and format the message field
Return the header string for a set of XML formatted records
Return the tail string for a set of XML formatted records
Format the given log record and return the formatted string The resulting formatted String will normally include a localized and formated version of the LogRecord's message field It is recommended to use the link FormatterformatMessage convenience method to localize and format the message field
Return the header string for a set of formatted records This base class returns an empty string but this may be overriden by subclasses
Return the tail string for a set of formatted records This base class returns an empty string but this may be overriden by subclasses
Localize and format the message string from a log record This method is provided as a convenience for Formatter subclasses to use when they are performing formatting The message string is first localized to a format string using the record's ResourceBundle If there is no ResourceBundle or if the message key is not found then the key is used as the format string The format String uses javatext style formatting If there are no parameters no formatter is used Otherwise if the string contains then javatextMessageFormat is used to format the string Otherwise no formatting is performed 
Return the level's localization resource bundle name or null if no localization bundle is defined
Return the nonlocalized string name of the Level
Return the localized string name of the Level for the current default locale If no localization information is available the nonlocalized name is returned
the nonlocalized name of the Level for example INFO
Get the integer value for this level This integer value can be used for efficient ordering comparisons between Level objects
Parse a level name string into a Level The argument string may consist of either a level name or an integer value For example SEVERE 
Compare two objects for value equality
Generate a hashcode
Close this output stream
Format and publish a LogRecord
Change the output stream If there is a current output stream then the Formatter's tail string is written and the stream is flushed and closed Then the output stream is replaced with the new output stream
Set or change the character encoding used by this Handler The encoding should be set before any LogRecords are written to the Handler
Format and publish a LogRecord The StreamHandler first checks if there is an OutputStream and if the given LogRecord has at least the required log level If not it silently returns If so it calls any associated Filter to check if the record should be published If so it calls its Formatter to format the record and then writes the result to the current output stream If this is the first LogRecord to be written to a given OutputStream the Formatter's head string is written to the stream before the LogRecord is written
Check if this Handler would actually log a given LogRecord This method checks if the LogRecord has an appropriate level and whether it satisfies any Filter It will also return false if no output stream has been assigned yet or the LogRecord is Null 
Flush any buffered messages
Close the current output stream The Formatter's tail string is written to the stream before it is closed In addition if the Formatter's head string has not yet been written to the stream it will be written before the tail string
Format the given LogRecord This method can be overridden in a subclass It is recommended to use the link FormatterformatMessage convenience method to localize and format the message field
Return the global LogManager object
Adds an event listener to be invoked when the logging properties are reread Adding multiple instances of the same event Listener results in multiple entries in the property event listener table
Removes an event listener for property change events If the same listener instance has been added to the listener table through multiple invocations of addPropertyChangeListener then an equivalent number of removePropertyChangeListener invocations are required to remove all instances of that listener from the listener table Returns silently if the given listener is not found
Add a named logger This does nothing and returns false if a logger with the same name is already registered The Logger factory methods call this method to register each newly created Logger The application should retain its own reference to the Logger object to avoid it being garbage collected The LogManager may only retain a weak reference
Method to find a named logger Note that since untrusted code may create loggers with arbitrary names this method should not be relied on to find Loggers for security sensitive logging It is also important to note that the Logger associated with the String code name may be garbage collected at any time if there is no strong reference to the Logger The caller of this method must check the return value for null in order to properly handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected 
Get an enumeration of known logger names Note Loggers may be added dynamically as new classes are loaded This method only reports on the loggers that are currently registered It is also important to note that this method only returns the name of a Logger not a strong reference to the Logger itself The returned String does nothing to prevent the Logger from being garbage collected In particular if the returned name is passed to code LogManagergetLogger then the caller must check the return value from code LogManagergetLogger for null to properly handle the case where the Logger has been garbage collected in the time since its name was returned by this method 
Reinitialize the logging properties and reread the logging configuration The same rules are used for locating the configuration properties as are used at startup So normally the logging properties will be reread from the same file that was used at startup Any log level definitions in the new configuration file will be applied using LoggersetLevel if the target Logger exists A PropertyChangeEvent will be fired after the properties are read
Reset the logging configuration For all named loggers the reset operation removes and closes all Handlers and except for the root logger sets the level to null The root logger's level is set to LevelINFO
Reinitialize the logging properties and reread the logging configuration from the given stream which should be in javautilProperties format A PropertyChangeEvent will be fired after the properties are read Any log level definitions in the new configuration file will be applied using LoggersetLevel if the target Logger exists
Get the value of a logging property The method returns null if the property is not found
Check that the current context is trusted to modify the logging configuration This requires LoggingPermissioncontrol If the check fails we throw a SecurityException otherwise we return normally

Get the name of the method that allegedly issued the logging request Note that this sourceMethodName is not verified and may be spoofed This information may either have been provided as part of the logging call or it may have been inferred automatically by the logging framework In the latter case the information may only be approximate and may in fact describe an earlier call on the stack frame May be null if no information could be obtained
Set the name of the method that allegedly issued the logging request
Get the raw log message before localization or formatting May be null which is equivalent to the empty string This message may be either the final text or a localization key During formatting if the source logger has a localization ResourceBundle and if that ResourceBundle has an entry for this message string then the message string is replaced with the localized value
Set the raw log message before localization or formatting
Get the parameters to the log message
Set the parameters to the log message

Create an anonymous Logger The newly created Logger is not registered in the LogManager namespace There will be no access checks on updates to the logger This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private by the creating class This removes the need for normal security checks which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update the control state of the Logger For example an applet can do a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger Even although the new logger is anonymous it is configured to have the root logger as its parent This means that by default it inherits its effective level and handlers from the root logger

Set the log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this logger Message levels lower than this value will be discarded The level value LevelOFF can be used to turn off logging If the new level is null it means that this node should inherit its level from its nearest ancestor with a specific nonnull level value
Get the log Level that has been specified for this Logger The result may be null which means that this logger's effective level will be inherited from its parent
Check if a message of the given level would actually be logged by this logger This check is based on the Loggers effective level which may be inherited from its parent
Get the name for this logger

Returns the list of currently registered loggers This method calls link LogManagergetLoggerNames and returns a list of the logger names
Gets the name of the log level associated with the specified logger If the specified logger does not exist null is returned This method first finds the logger of the given name and then returns the name of the log level by calling link LoggergetLevel LoggergetLevellink LevelgetName getName If the Level of the specified logger is null which means that this logger's effective level is inherited from its parent an empty string will be returned
Sets the specified logger to the specified new level If the levelName is not null the level of the specified logger is set to the parsed Level matching the levelName If the levelName is null the level of the specified logger is set to null and the effective level of the logger is inherited from its nearest ancestor with a specific nonnull level value
Returns the name of the parent for the specified logger If the specified logger does not exist null is returned If the specified logger is the root Logger in the namespace the result will be an empty string

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time a code true return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever acquire In this implementation this operation returns in constant time
Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this synchronizer that is if an acquire method has ever blocked In this implementation this operation returns in constant time
Returns the first longestwaiting thread in the queue or code null if no threads are currently queued In this implementation this operation normally returns in constant time but may iterate upon contention if other threads are concurrently modifying the queue
Version of getFirstQueuedThread called when fastpath fails
Returns true if the given thread is currently queued This implementation traverses the queue to determine presence of the given thread
Returns code true if the apparent first queued thread if one exists is waiting in exclusive mode If this method returns code true and the current thread is attempting to acquire in shared mode that is this method is invoked from link tryAcquireShared then it is guaranteed that the current thread is not the first queued thread Used only as a heuristic in ReentrantReadWriteLock
Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer than the current thread An invocation of this method is equivalent to but may be more efficient than code getFirstQueuedThread ThreadcurrentThread hasQueuedThreads Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time a code true return does not guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current thread Likewise it is possible for another thread to win a race to enqueue after this method has returned code false due to the queue being empty This method is designed to be used by a fair synchronizer to avoid barging Such a synchronizer's link tryAcquire method should return code false and its link tryAcquireShared method should return a negative value if this method returns code true unless this is a reentrant acquire For example the code tryAcquire method for a fair reentrant exclusive mode synchronizer might look like this code protected boolean tryAcquireint arg if isHeldExclusively A reentrant acquire increment hold count return true else if hasQueuedPredecessors return false else try to acquire normally

Returns a RunnableFuture for the given runnable and default value
Returns a RunnableFuture for the given callable task
the main mechanics of invokeAny
Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed but no new tasks will be accepted Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down
Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks halts the processing of waiting tasks and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution There are no guarantees beyond besteffort attempts to stop processing actively executing tasks For example typical implementations will cancel via link Threadinterrupt so any task that fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate
Returns true if this executor has been shut down
Returns true if all tasks have completed following shut down Note that isTerminated is never true unless either shutdown or shutdownNow was called first
Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown request or the timeout occurs or the current thread is interrupted whichever happens first
Submits a valuereturning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task The Future's get method will return the task's result upon successful completion If you would like to immediately block waiting for a task you can use constructions of the form result execsubmitaCallableget Note The link Executors class includes a set of methods that can convert some other common closurelike objects for example link javasecurityPrivilegedAction to link Callable form so they can be submitted

Returns a shallow copy of this ConcurrentSkipListSet instance The elements themselves are not cloned
Returns the number of elements in this set If this set contains more than IntegerMAX_VALUE elements it returns IntegerMAX_VALUE Beware that unlike in most collections this method is NOT a constanttime operation Because of the asynchronous nature of these sets determining the current number of elements requires traversing them all to count them Additionally it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method in which case the returned result will be inaccurate Thus this method is typically not very useful in concurrent applications

Returns a baselevel node with key strictly less than given key or the baselevel header if there is no such node Also unlinks indexes to deleted nodes found along the way Callers rely on this sideeffect of clearing indices to deleted nodes
Returns node holding key or null if no such clearing out any deleted nodes seen along the way Repeatedly traverses at baselevel looking for key starting at predecessor returned from findPredecessor processing baselevel deletions as encountered Some callers rely on this sideeffect of clearing deleted nodes Restarts occur at traversal step centered on node n if After reading n's next field n is no longer assumed predecessor b's current successor which means that we don't have a consistent node snapshot and so cannot unlink any subsequent deleted nodes encountered n's value field is null indicating n is deleted in which case we help out an ongoing structural deletion before retrying Even though there are cases where such unlinking doesn't require restart they aren't sorted out here because doing so would not usually outweigh cost of restarting n is a marker or n's predecessor's value field is null indicating among other possibilities that findPredecessor returned a deleted node We can't unlink the node because we don't know its predecessor so rely on another call to findPredecessor to notice and return some earlier predecessor which it will do This check is only strictly needed at beginning of loop and the bvalue check isn't strictly needed at all but is done each iteration to help avoid contention with other threads by callers that will fail to be able to change links and so will retry anyway The traversal loops in doPut doRemove and findNear all include the same three kinds of checks And specialized versions appear in findFirst and findLast and their variants They can't easily share code because each uses the reads of fields held in locals occurring in the orders they were performed
Specialized variant of findNode to perform Mapget Does a weak traversal not bothering to fix any deleted index nodes returning early if it happens to see key in index and passing over any deleted base nodes falling back to getUsingFindNode only if it would otherwise return value from an ongoing deletion Also uses bound to eliminate need for some comparisons see Pugh Cookbook Also folds uses of null checks and nodeskipping because markers have null keys

Creates and adds index nodes for the given node
Adds given index nodes from given level down to 
Main deletion method Locates node nulls value appends a deletion marker unlinks predecessor removes associated index nodes and possibly reduces head index level Index nodes are cleared out simply by calling findPredecessor which unlinks indexes to deleted nodes found along path to key which will include the indexes to this node This is done unconditionally We can't check beforehand whether there are index nodes because it might be the case that some or all indexes hadn't been inserted yet for this node during initial search for it and we'd like to ensure lack of garbage retention so must call to be sure
Possibly reduce head level if it has no nodes This method can rarely make mistakes in which case levels can disappear even though they are about to contain index nodes This impacts performance not correctness To minimize mistakes as well as to reduce hysteresis the level is reduced by one only if the topmost three levels look empty Also if the removed level looks nonempty after CAS we try to change it back quick before anyone notices our mistake This trick works pretty well because this method will practically never make mistakes unless current thread stalls immediately before first CAS in which case it is very unlikely to stall again immediately afterwards so will recover We put up with all this rather than just let levels grow because otherwise even a small map that has undergone a large number of insertions and removals will have a lot of levels slowing down access more than would an occasional unwanted reduction

Transitions runState to given target or leaves it alone if already at least the given target
Transitions to TERMINATED state if either SHUTDOWN and pool and queue empty or STOP and pool empty If otherwise eligible to terminate but workerCount is nonzero interrupts an idle worker to ensure that shutdown signals propagate This method must be called following any action that might make termination possible reducing worker count or removing tasks from the queue during shutdown The method is nonprivate to allow access from ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
If there is a security manager makes sure caller has permission to shut down threads in general see shutdownPerm If this passes additionally makes sure the caller is allowed to interrupt each worker thread This might not be true even if first check passed if the SecurityManager treats some threads specially

Performs cleanup and bookkeeping for a dying worker Called only from worker threads Unless completedAbruptly is set assumes that workerCount has already been adjusted to account for exit This method removes thread from worker set and possibly terminates the pool or replaces the worker if either it exited due to user task exception or if fewer than corePoolSize workers are running or queue is nonempty but there are no workers
Performs blocking or timed wait for a task depending on current configuration settings or returns null if this worker must exit because of any of There are more than maximumPoolSize workers due to a call to setMaximumPoolSize The pool is stopped The pool is shutdown and the queue is empty This worker timed out waiting for a task and timedout workers are subject to termination that is code allowCoreThreadTimeOut || workerCount corePoolSize both before and after the timed wait
Main worker run loop Repeatedly gets tasks from queue and executes them while coping with a number of issues We may start out with an initial task in which case we don't need to get the first one Otherwise as long as pool is running we get tasks from getTask If it returns null then the worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration parameters Other exits result from exception throws in external code in which case completedAbruptly holds which usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread Before running any task the lock is acquired to prevent other pool interrupts while the task is executing and clearInterruptsForTaskRun called to ensure that unless pool is stopping this thread does not have its interrupt set Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute which might throw an exception in which case we cause thread to die breaking loop with completedAbruptly true without processing the task Assuming beforeExecute completes normally we run the task gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to afterExecute We separately handle RuntimeException Error both of which the specs guarantee that we trap and arbitrary Throwables Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within Runnablerun we wrap them within Errors on the way out to the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler Any thrown exception also conservatively causes thread to die After taskrun completes we call afterExecute which may also throw an exception which will also cause thread to die According to JLS Sec this exception is the one that will be in effect even if taskrun throws The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate information as we can provide about any problems encountered by user code
Executes the given task sometime in the future The task may execute in a new thread or in an existing pooled thread If the task cannot be submitted for execution either because this executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached the task is handled by the current code RejectedExecutionHandler
Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed but no new tasks will be accepted Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down
Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks halts the processing of waiting tasks and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution These tasks are drained removed from the task queue upon return from this method There are no guarantees beyond besteffort attempts to stop processing actively executing tasks This implementation cancels tasks via link Threadinterrupt so any task that fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate
Returns true if this executor is in the process of terminating after link shutdown or link shutdownNow but has not completely terminated This method may be useful for debugging A return of code true reported a sufficient period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have ignored or suppressed interruption causing this executor not to properly terminate
Invokes code shutdown when this executor is no longer referenced and it has no threads

Returns true if this pool allows core threads to time out and terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAlive time being replaced if needed when new tasks arrive When true the same keepalive policy applying to noncore threads applies also to core threads When false the default core threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming tasks
Sets the policy governing whether core threads may time out and terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepalive time being replaced if needed when new tasks arrive When false core threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming tasks When true the same keepalive policy applying to noncore threads applies also to core threads To avoid continual thread replacement the keepalive time must be greater than zero when setting code true This method should in general be called before the pool is actively used
Sets the maximum allowed number of threads This overrides any value set in the constructor If the new value is smaller than the current value excess existing threads will be terminated when they next become idle
Returns the maximum allowed number of threads
Sets the time limit for which threads may remain idle before being terminated If there are more than the core number of threads currently in the pool after waiting this amount of time without processing a task excess threads will be terminated This overrides any value set in the constructor
Returns the thread keepalive time which is the amount of time that threads in excess of the core pool size may remain idle before being terminated
Returns the task queue used by this executor Access to the task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring This queue may be in active use Retrieving the task queue does not prevent queued tasks from executing
Removes this task from the executor's internal queue if it is present thus causing it not to be run if it has not already started This method may be useful as one part of a cancellation scheme It may fail to remove tasks that have been converted into other forms before being placed on the internal queue For example a task entered using code submit might be converted into a form that maintains code Future status However in such cases method link purge may be used to remove those Futures that have been cancelled
Tries to remove from the work queue all link Future tasks that have been cancelled This method can be useful as a storage reclamation operation that has no other impact on functionality Cancelled tasks are never executed but may accumulate in work queues until worker threads can actively remove them Invoking this method instead tries to remove them now However this method may fail to remove tasks in the presence of interference by other threads
Returns the current number of threads in the pool
Returns the approximate number of threads that are actively executing tasks
Returns the largest number of threads that have ever simultaneously been in the pool

Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution Because the states of tasks and threads may change dynamically during computation the returned value is only an approximation but one that does not ever decrease across successive calls
Method invoked prior to executing the given Runnable in the given thread This method is invoked by thread code t that will execute task code r and may be used to reinitialize ThreadLocals or to perform logging This implementation does nothing but may be customized in subclasses Note To properly nest multiple overridings subclasses should generally invoke code superbeforeExecute at the end of this method
Method invoked upon completion of execution of the given Runnable This method is invoked by the thread that executed the task If nonnull the Throwable is the uncaught code RuntimeException or code Error that caused execution to terminate abruptly This implementation does nothing but may be customized in subclasses Note To properly nest multiple overridings subclasses should generally invoke code superafterExecute at the beginning of this method Note When actions are enclosed in tasks such as link FutureTask either explicitly or via methods such as code submit these task objects catch and maintain computational exceptions and so they do not cause abrupt termination and the internal exceptions are not passed to this method If you would like to trap both kinds of failures in this method you can further probe for such cases as in this sample subclass that prints either the direct cause or the underlying exception if a task has been aborted code class ExtendedExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor protected void afterExecuteRunnable r Throwable t superafterExecuter t if t null r instanceof Future try Object result Future rget catch CancellationException ce t ce catch ExecutionException ee t eegetCause catch InterruptedException ie ThreadcurrentThreadinterrupt ignorereset if t null Systemoutprintlnt

Spinwaits for hole for a non slot Fails if spin elapses before hole filled Does not check interrupt relying on check in public exchange method to abort if interrupted on entry
Waits for by spinning andor blocking and gets the hole filled in by another thread Fails if interrupted before hole filled When a nodethread is about to block it sets its waiter field and then rechecks state at least one more time before actually parking thus covering race vs fulfiller noticing that waiter is nonnull so should be woken Thread interruption status is checked only surrounding calls to park The caller is assumed to have checked interrupt status on entry

Sweeps through arena checking for any waiting threads Called only upon return from timeout while waiting in slot When a thread gives up on a timed wait it is possible that a previouslyentered thread is still waiting in some other slot So we scan to check for any This is almost always overkill but decreases the likelihood of timeouts when there are other threads present to far less than that in lockbased exchangers in which earlierarriving threads may still be waiting on entry locks

Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire Note that because cancellations may occur at any time a code true return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever acquire This method is designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal data structures This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state not for synchronization control
Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result the returned collection is only a besteffort estimate The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order This method is designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities
Returns a string identifying this semaphore as well as its state The state in brackets includes the String code Permits followed by the number of permits
Attempts to cancel execution of this task This attempt will fail if the task has already completed has already been cancelled or could not be cancelled for some other reason If successful and this task has not started when cancel is called this task should never run If the task has already started then the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter determines whether the thread executing this task should be interrupted in an attempt to stop the task After this method returns subsequent calls to link isDone will always return true Subsequent calls to link isCancelled will always return true if this method returned true
Returns true if this task was cancelled before it completed normally
Returns true if this task completed Completion may be due to normal termination an exception or cancellation in all of these cases this method will return true

Given a specific sequence composed of a regular character and combining marks that follow it produce the alternation that will match all canonical equivalences of that sequence
Returns an array of strings that have all the possible permutations of the characters in the input string This is used to get a list of all possible orderings of a set of combining marks Note that some of the permutations are invalid because of combining class collisions and these possibilities must be removed because they are not canonically equivalent
Attempts to compose input by combining the first character with the first combining mark following it Returns a String that is the composition of the leading character with its first combining mark followed by the remaining combining marks Returns null if the first two characters cannot be further composed

Given a set of encoded rules in startDay and startDayOfMonth decode them and set the startMode appropriately Do the same for endDay and endDayOfMonth Upon entry the day of week variables may be zero or negative in order to indicate special modes The day of month variables may also be negative Upon exit the mode variables will be set and the day of week and day of month variables will be positive This method also recognizes a startDay or endDay of zero as indicating no DST
Decode the start rule and validate the parameters The parameters are expected to be in encoded form which represents the various rule modes by negating or zeroing certain values Representation formats are DOW_IN_MONTH DOM DOWDOM DOWDOM no DST month same same same don't care day dayOfWeek don't care time ONEDAY same same same don't care The range for month does not include UNDECIMBER since this class is really specific to GregorianCalendar which does not use that month The range for time includes ONEDAY vs ending at ONEDAY because the end rule is an exclusive limit point That is the range of times that are in DST include those the start and the end For this reason it should be possible to specify an end of ONEDAY in order to include the entire day Although this is equivalent to time of the following day it's not always possible to specify that for example on December While arguably the start range should still be ONEDAY we keep the start and end ranges the same for consistency
Decode the end rule and validate the parameters This method is exactly analogous to decodeStartRule

Adds the specified signed amount of time to the given calendar field based on the calendar's rules Add rule The value of field after the call minus the value of field before the call is amount modulo any overflow that has occurred in field Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its range and as a result the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range Add rule If a smaller field is expected to be invariant but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field is changed then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time HOUR is a smaller field than DAY_OF_MONTH No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant The calendar system determines what fields are expected to be invariant
Adds or subtracts updown a single unit of time on the given time field without changing larger fields Example Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to December Calling link rollintboolean rollCalendarMONTH true sets the calendar to January The YEAR field is unchanged because it is a larger field than MONTH
Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing larger fields If the specified amount is this method performs nothing This method calls link complete before adding the amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized If there is any calendar field having an outofrange value in nonlenient mode then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown Example Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to August Calling rollCalendarMONTH sets the calendar to April Using a GregorianCalendar the DAY_OF_MONTH field cannot be in the month April DAY_OF_MONTH is set to the closest possible value The YEAR field maintains the value of because it is a larger field than MONTH Example Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to Sunday June Calling rollCalendarWEEK_OF_MONTH sets the calendar to Tuesday June whereas calling addCalendarWEEK_OF_MONTH sets the calendar to Sunday May This is because the roll rule imposes an additional constraint The MONTH must not change when the WEEK_OF_MONTH is rolled Taken together with add rule the resultant date must be between Tuesday June and Saturday June According to add rule the DAY_OF_WEEK an invariant when changing the WEEK_OF_MONTH is set to Tuesday the closest possible value to Sunday where Sunday is the first day of the week

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator this method must return the elements in the same order The returned array will be safe in that no references to it are maintained by this collection In other words this method must allocate a new array even if this collection is backed by an array The caller is thus free to modify the returned array This method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array If the collection fits in the specified array it is returned therein Otherwise a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this collection If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare ie the array has more elements than this collection the element in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to null This is useful in determining the length of this collection only if the caller knows that this collection does not contain any null elements If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator this method must return the elements in the same order Like the link toArray method this method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs Further this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array and may under certain circumstances be used to save allocation costs Suppose x is a collection known to contain only strings The following code can be used to dump the collection into a newly allocated array of String String y xtoArraynew String Note that toArraynew Object is identical in function to toArray
Ensures that this collection contains the specified element optional operation Returns true if this collection changed as a result of the call Returns false if this collection does not permit duplicates and already contains the specified element Collections that support this operation may place limitations on what elements may be added to this collection In particular some collections will refuse to add null elements and others will impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added Collection classes should clearly specify in their documentation any restrictions on what elements may be added If a collection refuses to add a particular element for any reason other than that it already contains the element it must throw an exception rather than returning false This preserves the invariant that a collection always contains the specified element after this call returns
Removes a single instance of the specified element from this collection if it is present optional operation More formally removes an element e such that onullnbspnbspenullnbspnbspoequalse if this collection contains one or more such elements Returns true if this collection contained the specified element or equivalently if this collection changed as a result of the call
Returns true if this collection contains all of the elements in the specified collection
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this collection optional operation The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified collection is this collection and this collection is nonempty

Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection optional operation In other words removes from this collection all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection
Removes all of the elements from this collection optional operation The collection will be empty after this method returns
Compares the specified object with this collection for equality While the Collection interface adds no stipulations to the general contract for the Objectequals programmers who implement the Collection interface directly in other words create a class that is a Collection but is not a Set or a List must exercise care if they choose to override the Objectequals It is not necessary to do so and the simplest course of action is to rely on Object's implementation but the implementor may wish to implement a value comparison in place of the default reference comparison The List and Set interfaces mandate such value comparisons The general contract for the Objectequals method states that equals must be symmetric in other words aequalsb if and only if bequalsa The contracts for Listequals and Setequals state that lists are only equal to other lists and sets to other sets Thus a custom equals method for a collection class that implements neither the List nor Set interface must return false when this collection is compared to any list or set By the same logic it is not possible to write a class that correctly implements both the Set and List interfaces
Returns the hash code value for this collection While the Collection interface adds no stipulations to the general contract for the ObjecthashCode method programmers should take note that any class that overrides the Objectequals method must also override the ObjecthashCode method in order to satisfy the general contract for the ObjecthashCodemethod In particular cequalsc implies that chashCodechashCode

Returns all of the keys that have an associated value in this preference node The returned array will be of size zero if this node has no preferences If the implementation supports stored defaults and there are any such defaults at this node that have not been overridden by explicit preferences the defaults are returned in the array in addition to any explicit preferences
Returns the names of the children of this preference node relative to this node The returned array will be of size zero if this node has no children
Returns the parent of this preference node or null if this is the root
Returns the named preference node in the same tree as this node creating it and any of its ancestors if they do not already exist Accepts a relative or absolute path name Relative path names which do not begin with the slash character '' are interpreted relative to this preference node If the returned node did not exist prior to this call this node and any ancestors that were created by this call are not guaranteed to become permanent until the flush method is called on the returned node or one of its ancestors or descendants
Returns true if the named preference node exists in the same tree as this node Relative path names which do not begin with the slash character '' are interpreted relative to this preference node If this node or an ancestor has already been removed with the link removeNode method it is legal to invoke this method but only with the path name the invocation will return false Thus the idiom pnodeExists may be used to test whether p has been removed
Removes this preference node and all of its descendants invalidating any preferences contained in the removed nodes Once a node has been removed attempting any method other than link name link absolutePath link isUserNode link flush or link nodeString nodeExists on the corresponding Preferences instance will fail with an IllegalStateException The methods defined on link Object can still be invoked on a node after it has been removed they will not throw IllegalStateException The removal is not guaranteed to be persistent until the flush method is called on this node or an ancestor If this implementation supports stored defaults removing a node exposes any stored defaults at or below this node Thus a subsequent call to nodeExists on this node's path name may return true and a subsequent call to node on this path name may return a different Preferences instance representing a nonempty collection of preferences andor children
Returns this preference node's name relative to its parent
Returns this preference node's absolute path name

Forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its descendants to the persistent store Once this method returns successfully it is safe to assume that all changes made in the subtree rooted at this node prior to the method invocation have become permanent Implementations are free to flush changes into the persistent store at any time They do not need to wait for this method to be called When a flush occurs on a newly created node it is made persistent as are any ancestors and descendants that have yet to be made persistent Note however that any preference value changes in ancestors are not guaranteed to be made persistent If this method is invoked on a node that has been removed with the link removeNode method flushSpi is invoked on this node but not on others
Ensures that future reads from this preference node and its descendants reflect any changes that were committed to the persistent store from any VM prior to the sync invocation As a sideeffect forces any changes in the contents of this preference node and its descendants to the persistent store as if the flush method had been invoked on this node
Registers the specified listener to receive preference change events for this preference node A preference change event is generated when a preference is added to this node removed from this node or when the value associated with a preference is changed Preference change events are not generated by the link removeNode method which generates a node change event Preference change events are generated by the clear method Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM as the registered listener though some implementations may generate events for changes made outside this JVM Events may be generated before the changes have been made persistent Events are not generated when preferences are modified in descendants of this node a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant
Removes the specified preference change listener so it no longer receives preference change events
Registers the specified listener to receive node change events for this node A node change event is generated when a child node is added to or removed from this node A single link removeNode invocation results in multiple node change events one for every node in the subtree rooted at the removed node Events are only guaranteed for changes made within the same JVM as the registered listener though some implementations may generate events for changes made outside this JVM Events may be generated before the changes have become permanent Events are not generated when indirect descendants of this node are added or removed a caller desiring such events must register with each descendant Few guarantees can be made regarding node creation Because nodes are created implicitly upon access it may not be feasible for an implementation to determine whether a child node existed in the backing store prior to access for example because the backing store is unreachable or cached information is out of date Under these circumstances implementations are neither required to generate node change events nor prohibited from doing so
Removes the specified NodeChangeListener so it no longer receives change events

Sets the seed of this random number generator using a single code long seed The general contract of code setSeed is that it alters the state of this random number generator object so as to be in exactly the same state as if it had just been created with the argument code seed as a seed The method code setSeed is implemented by class code Random by atomically updating the seed to code seed ^ xDEECEDL L and clearing the code haveNextNextGaussian flag used by link nextGaussian The implementation of code setSeed by class code Random happens to use only bits of the given seed In general however an overriding method may use all bits of the code long argument as a seed value
Generates the next pseudorandom number Subclasses should override this as this is used by all other methods The general contract of code next is that it returns an code int value and if the argument code bits is between code and code inclusive then that many loworder bits of the returned value will be approximately independently chosen bit values each of which is approximately equally likely to be code or code The method code next is implemented by class code Random by atomically updating the seed to code seed xDEECEDL xBL L and returning code intseed bits This is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator as defined by D H Lehmer and described by Donald E Knuth in The Art of Computer Programming Volume Seminumerical Algorithms section

Returns the next pseudorandom uniformly distributed code long value from this random number generator's sequence The general contract of code nextLong is that one code long value is pseudorandomly generated and returned The method code nextLong is implemented by class code Random as if by code public long nextLong return longnext next Because class code Random uses a seed with only bits this algorithm will not return all possible code long values

Returns the next pseudorandom uniformly distributed code double value between code and code from this random number generator's sequence The general contract of code nextDouble is that one code double value chosen approximately uniformly from the range code d inclusive to code d exclusive is pseudorandomly generated and returned The method code nextDouble is implemented by class code Random as if by code public double nextDouble return longnext next doubleL The hedge approximately is used in the foregoing description only because the code next method is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits If it were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits then the algorithm shown would choose code double values from the stated range with perfect uniformity In early versions of Java the result was incorrectly calculated as code return longnext next doubleL This might seem to be equivalent if not better but in fact it introduced a large nonuniformity because of the bias in the rounding of floatingpoint numbers it was three times as likely that the loworder bit of the significand would be than that it would be This nonuniformity probably doesn't matter much in practice but we strive for perfection

Returns a listiterator of the elements in this list in proper sequence starting at the specified position in the list Obeys the general contract of ListlistIteratorint The listiterator is failfast if the list is structurally modified at any time after the Iterator is created in any way except through the listiterator's own remove or add methods the listiterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException Thus in the face of concurrent modification the iterator fails quickly and cleanly rather than risking arbitrary nondeterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future

Returns a shallow copy of this LinkedList The elements themselves are not cloned
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence from first to last element The returned array will be safe in that no references to it are maintained by this list In other words this method must allocate a new array The caller is thus free to modify the returned array This method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence from first to last element the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array If the list fits in the specified array it is returned therein Otherwise a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this list If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare ie the array has more elements than the list the element in the array immediately following the end of the list is set to null This is useful in determining the length of the list only if the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements Like the link toArray method this method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs Further this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array and may under certain circumstances be used to save allocation costs Suppose x is a list known to contain only strings The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly allocated array of String String y xtoArraynew String Note that toArraynew Object is identical in function to toArray

Gets a string array for the given key from this resource bundle or one of its parents Calling this method is equivalent to calling String link getObjectjavalangString getObjectkey 
Gets an object for the given key from this resource bundle or one of its parents This method first tries to obtain the object from this resource bundle using link handleGetObjectjavalangString handleGetObject If not successful and the parent resource bundle is not null it calls the parent's getObject method If still not successful it throws a MissingResourceException
Returns the locale of this resource bundle This method can be used after a call to getBundle to determine whether the resource bundle returned really corresponds to the requested locale or is a fallback
Sets the parent bundle of this bundle The parent bundle is searched by link getObject getObject when this bundle does not contain a particular resource
Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name the default locale and the caller's class loader Calling this method is equivalent to calling getBundlebaseName LocalegetDefault thisgetClassgetClassLoader except that getClassLoader is run with the security privileges of ResourceBundle See link getBundleString Locale ClassLoader getBundle for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy
Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name the default locale and the specified control Calling this method is equivalent to calling getBundlebaseName LocalegetDefault thisgetClassgetClassLoader control except that getClassLoader is run with the security privileges of ResourceBundle See link getBundleString Locale ClassLoader Control getBundle for the complete description of the resource bundle loading process with a ResourceBundleControl
Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name and locale and the caller's class loader Calling this method is equivalent to calling getBundlebaseName locale thisgetClassgetClassLoader except that getClassLoader is run with the security privileges of ResourceBundle See link getBundleString Locale ClassLoader getBundle for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy

Gets a resource bundle using the specified base name locale and class loader Conceptually getBundle uses the following strategy for locating and instantiating resource bundles getBundle uses the base name the specified locale and the default locale obtained from link javautilLocalegetDefault LocalegetDefault to generate a sequence of candidate bundle names If the specified locale's language country and variant are all empty strings then the base name is the only candidate bundle name Otherwise the following sequence is generated from the attribute values of the specified locale language country and variant and of the default locale language country and variant baseName _ language _ country _ variant baseName _ language _ country baseName _ language baseName _ language _ country _ variant baseName _ language _ country baseName _ language baseName Candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string are omitted For example if country is an empty string the second candidate bundle name is omitted getBundle then iterates over the candidate bundle names to find the first one for which it can instantiate an actual resource bundle For each candidate bundle name it attempts to create a resource bundle First it attempts to load a class using the candidate bundle name If such a class can be found and loaded using the specified class loader is assignment compatible with ResourceBundle is accessible from ResourceBundle and can be instantiated getBundle creates a new instance of this class and uses it as the result resource bundle Otherwise getBundle attempts to locate a property resource file It generates a path name from the candidate bundle name by replacing all characters with and appending the string properties It attempts to find a resource with this name using link javalangClassLoadergetResourcejavalangString ClassLoadergetResource Note that a resource in the sense of getResource has nothing to do with the contents of a resource bundle it is just a container of data such as a file If it finds a resource it attempts to create a new link PropertyResourceBundle instance from its contents If successful this instance becomes the result resource bundle If no result resource bundle has been found a MissingResourceException is thrown Once a result resource bundle has been found its parent chain is instantiated getBundle iterates over the candidate bundle names that can be obtained by successively removing variant country and language each time with the preceding _ from the bundle name of the result resource bundle As above candidate bundle names where the final component is an empty string are omitted With each of the candidate bundle names it attempts to instantiate a resource bundle as described above Whenever it succeeds it calls the previously instantiated resource bundle's link setParentjavautilResourceBundle setParent method with the new resource bundle unless the previously instantiated resource bundle already has a nonnull parent getBundle caches instantiated resource bundles and may return the same resource bundle instance multiple times The baseName argument should be a fully qualified class name However for compatibility with earlier versions Sun's Java SE Runtime Environments do not verify this and so it is possible to access PropertyResourceBundles by specifying a path name using instead of a fully qualified class name using ExampleThe following class and property files are provided MyResourcesclass MyResourcesproperties MyResources_frproperties MyResources_fr_CHclass MyResources_fr_CHproperties MyResources_enproperties MyResources_es_ESclass The contents of all files are valid that is public nonabstract subclasses of ResourceBundle for the class files syntactically correct properties files The default locale is Localeen GB Calling getBundle with the shown locale argument values instantiates resource bundles from the following sources Localefr CH result MyResources_fr_CHclass parent MyResources_frproperties parent MyResourcesclass Localefr FR result MyResources_frproperties parent MyResourcesclass Localede DE result MyResources_enproperties parent MyResourcesclass Localeen US result MyResources_enproperties parent MyResourcesclass Localees ES result MyResources_es_ESclass parent MyResourcesclass The file MyResources_fr_CHproperties is never used because it is hidden by MyResources_fr_CHclass Likewise MyResourcesproperties is also hidden by MyResourcesclass
Returns a resource bundle using the specified base name target locale class loader and control Unlike the linkplain getBundleString Locale ClassLoader getBundle factory methods with no control argument the given control specifies how to locate and instantiate resource bundles Conceptually the bundle loading process with the given control is performed in the following steps This factory method looks up the resource bundle in the cache for the specified baseName targetLocale and loader If the requested resource bundle instance is found in the cache and the timetolive periods of the instance and all of its parent instances have not expired the instance is returned to the caller Otherwise this factory method proceeds with the loading process below The link ResourceBundleControlgetFormatsString controlgetFormats method is called to get resource bundle formats to produce bundle or resource names The strings javaclass and javaproperties designate classbased and linkplain PropertyResourceBundle propertybased resource bundles respectively Other strings starting with java are reserved for future extensions and must not be used for applicationdefined formats Other strings designate applicationdefined formats The link ResourceBundleControlgetCandidateLocalesString Locale controlgetCandidateLocales method is called with the target locale to get a list of candidate Locales for which resource bundles are searched The link ResourceBundleControlnewBundleString Locale String ClassLoader boolean controlnewBundle method is called to instantiate a ResourceBundle for the base bundle name a candidate locale and a format Refer to the note on the cache lookup below This step is iterated over all combinations of the candidate locales and formats until the newBundle method returns a ResourceBundle instance or the iteration has used up all the combinations For example if the candidate locales are Localede DE Localede and Locale and the formats are javaclass and javaproperties then the following is the sequence of localeformat combinations to be used to call controlnewBundle table stylewidth textalign left marginleft px border cellpadding cellspacing td styleverticalalign top textalign left fontweight bold width Locale td styleverticalalign top textalign left fontweight bold width format Localede DE javaclass Localede DE javaproperties Localede javaclass Localede javaproperties Locale javaclass Locale javaproperties If the previous step has found no resource bundle proceed to Step If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle a bundle for Locale and the candidate locale list only contained Locale return the bundle to the caller If a bundle has been found that is a base bundle but the candidate locale list contained locales other than Locale put the bundle on hold and proceed to Step If a bundle has been found that is not a base bundle proceed to Step The link ResourceBundleControlgetFallbackLocaleString Locale controlgetFallbackLocale method is called to get a fallback locale alternative to the current target locale to try further finding a resource bundle If the method returns a nonnull locale it becomes the next target locale and the loading process starts over from Step Otherwise if a base bundle was found and put on hold in a previous Step it is returned to the caller now Otherwise a MissingResourceException is thrown At this point we have found a resource bundle that's not the base bundle If this bundle set its parent during its instantiation it is returned to the caller Otherwise its a hrefResourceBundlehtmlparent_chainparent chain is instantiated based on the list of candidate locales from which it was found Finally the bundle is returned to the caller During the resource bundle loading process above this factory method looks up the cache before calling the link ControlnewBundleString Locale String ClassLoader boolean controlnewBundle method If the timetolive period of the resource bundle found in the cache has expired the factory method calls the link ResourceBundleControlneedsReloadString Locale String ClassLoader ResourceBundle long controlneedsReload method to determine whether the resource bundle needs to be reloaded If reloading is required the factory method calls controlnewBundle to reload the resource bundle If controlnewBundle returns null the factory method puts a dummy resource bundle in the cache as a mark of nonexistent resource bundles in order to avoid lookup overhead for subsequent requests Such dummy resource bundles are under the same expiration control as specified by control All resource bundles loaded are cached by default Refer to link ControlgetTimeToLiveStringLocale controlgetTimeToLive for details The following is an example of the bundle loading process with the default ResourceBundleControl implementation Conditions Base bundle name foobarMessages Requested Locale link LocaleITALY Default Locale link LocaleFRENCH Available resource bundles foobarMessages_frproperties and foobarMessagesproperties First getBundle tries loading a resource bundle in the following sequence class foobarMessages_it_IT file foobarMessages_it_ITproperties class foobarMessages_it file foobarMessages_itproperties class foobarMessages file foobarMessagesproperties At this point getBundle finds foobarMessagesproperties which is put on hold because it's the base bundle getBundle calls link ControlgetFallbackLocaleString Locale controlgetFallbackLocalefoobarMessages LocaleITALY which returns LocaleFRENCH Next getBundle tries loading a bundle in the following sequence class foobarMessages_fr file foobarMessages_frproperties class foobarMessages file foobarMessagesproperties getBundle finds foobarMessages_frproperties and creates a ResourceBundle instance Then getBundle sets up its parent chain from the list of the candiate locales Only foobarMessagesproperties is found in the list and getBundle creates a ResourceBundle instance that becomes the parent of the instance for foobarMessages_frproperties
Checks if the given List is not null not empty not having null in its elements
Determines whether any of resource bundles in the parent chain including the leaf have expired
Declares the beginning of actual resource bundle loading This method returns true if the declaration is successful and the current thread has been put in underConstruction If someone else has already begun loading this method waits until that loading work is complete and returns false
Declares the end of the bundle loading This method calls notifyAll for those who are waiting for this completion
Throw a MissingResourceException with proper message
Finds a bundle in the cache Any expired bundles are marked as `expired' and removed from the cache upon return
Put a new bundle in the cache
Removes all resource bundles from the cache that have been loaded using the caller's class loader

Converts the given baseName and locale to the bundle name This method is called from the default implementation of the link newBundleString Locale String ClassLoader boolean newBundle and link needsReloadString Locale String ClassLoader ResourceBundle long needsReload methods This implementation returns the following value baseName _ language _ country _ variant where language country and variant are the language country and variant values of locale respectively Final component values that are empty Strings are omitted along with the preceding '_' If all of the values are empty strings then baseName is returned For example if baseName is baseName and locale is LocalejanbspnbspXX then baseName_ja_thinsp_XX is returned If the given locale is Localeen then baseName_en is returned Overriding this method allows applications to use different conventions in the organization and packaging of localized resources
Converts the given bundleName to the form required by the link ClassLoadergetResource ClassLoadergetResource method by replacing all occurrences of '' in bundleName with '' and appending a '' and the given file suffix For example if bundleName is foobarMyResources_ja_JP and suffix is properties then foobarMyResources_ja_JPproperties is returned
Returns a ResourceBundleControl in which the link getFormatsString getFormats method returns the specified formats The formats must be equal to one of link ControlFORMAT_PROPERTIES link ControlFORMAT_CLASS or link ControlFORMAT_DEFAULT ResourceBundleControl instances returned by this method are singletons and threadsafe Specifying link ControlFORMAT_DEFAULT is equivalent to instantiating the ResourceBundleControl class except that this method returns a singleton

Returns a List of Strings containing formats to be used to load resource bundles for the given baseName The ResourceBundlegetBundle factory method tries to load resource bundles with formats in the order specified by the list The list returned by this method must have at least one String The predefined formats are javaclass for classbased resource bundles and javaproperties for linkplain PropertyResourceBundle propertiesbased ones Strings starting with java are reserved for future extensions and must not be used by applicationdefined formats It is not a requirement to return an immutable unmodifiable List However the returned List must not be mutated after it has been returned by getFormats The default implementation returns link FORMAT_DEFAULT so that the ResourceBundlegetBundle factory method looks up first classbased resource bundles then propertiesbased ones
Returns a List of Locales as candidate locales for baseName and locale This method is called by the ResourceBundlegetBundle factory method each time the factory method tries finding a resource bundle for a target Locale The sequence of the candidate locales also corresponds to the runtime resource lookup path also known as the parent chain if the corresponding resource bundles for the candidate locales exist and their parents are not defined by loaded resource bundles themselves The last element of the list must be a linkplain LocaleROOT root locale if it is desired to have the base bundle as the terminal of the parent chain If the given locale is equal to LocaleROOT the root locale a List containing only the root Locale must be returned In this case the ResourceBundlegetBundle factory method loads only the base bundle as the resulting resource bundle It is not a requirement to return an immutable unmodifiable List However the returned List must not be mutated after it has been returned by getCandidateLocales The default implementation returns a List containing Locales in the following sequence Localelanguage country variant Localelanguage country Localelanguage LocaleROOT where language country and variant are the language country and variant values of the given locale respectively Locales where the final component values are empty strings are omitted The default implementation uses an link ArrayList that overriding implementations may modify before returning it to the caller However a subclass must not modify it after it has been returned by getCandidateLocales For example if the given baseName is Messages and the given locale is LocalejanbspnbspXX then a List of Locales Localeja XX Localeja LocaleROOT is returned And if the resource bundles for the ja and Locales are found then the runtime resource lookup path parent chain is Messages_ja Messages 
Returns a Locale to be used as a fallback locale for further resource bundle searches by the ResourceBundlegetBundle factory method This method is called from the factory method every time when no resulting resource bundle has been found for baseName and locale where locale is either the parameter for ResourceBundlegetBundle or the previous fallback locale returned by this method The method returns null if no further fallback search is desired The default implementation returns the linkplain LocalegetDefault default Locale if the given locale isn't the default one Otherwise null is returned
Instantiates a resource bundle for the given bundle name of the given format and locale using the given class loader if necessary This method returns null if there is no resource bundle available for the given parameters If a resource bundle can't be instantiated due to an unexpected error the error must be reported by throwing an Error or Exception rather than simply returning null If the reload flag is true it indicates that this method is being called because the previously loaded resource bundle has expired The default implementation instantiates a ResourceBundle as follows The bundle name is obtained by calling link toBundleNameString Locale toBundleNamebaseName locale If format is javaclass the link Class specified by the bundle name is loaded by calling link ClassLoaderloadClassString Then a ResourceBundle is instantiated by calling link ClassnewInstance Note that the reload flag is ignored for loading classbased resource bundles in this default implementation If format is javaproperties link toResourceNameString String toResourceNamebundlename properties is called to get the resource name If reload is true link ClassLoadergetResourceString loadgetResource is called to get a link URL for creating a link URLConnection This URLConnection is used to linkplain URLConnectionsetUseCachesboolean disable the caches of the underlying resource loading layers and to linkplain URLConnectiongetInputStream get an InputStream Otherwise link ClassLoadergetResourceAsStreamString loadergetResourceAsStream is called to get an link InputStream Then a link PropertyResourceBundle is constructed with the InputStream If format is neither javaclass nor javaproperties an IllegalArgumentException is thrown

Returns a list iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence starting at the specified position in the list The specified index indicates the first element that would be returned by an initial call to link ListIteratornext next An initial call to link ListIteratorprevious previous would return the element with the specified index minus one
Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified fromIndex inclusive and toIndex exclusive If fromIndex and toIndex are equal the returned list is empty The returned list is backed by this list so nonstructural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list and viceversa The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported by this list This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations of the sort that commonly exist for arrays Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list For example the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list listsubListfrom toclear Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to a subList The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list ie this list is structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list Structural modifications are those that change the size of this list or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results

Clear this loader's provider cache so that all providers will be reloaded After invoking this method subsequent invocations of the link iterator iterator method will lazily look up and instantiate providers from scratch just as is done by a newlycreated loader This method is intended for use in situations in which new providers can be installed into a running Java virtual machine
Lazily loads the available providers of this loader's service The iterator returned by this method first yields all of the elements of the provider cache in instantiation order It then lazily loads and instantiates any remaining providers adding each one to the cache in turn To achieve laziness the actual work of parsing the available providerconfiguration files and instantiating providers must be done by the iterator itself Its link javautilIteratorhasNext hasNext and link javautilIteratornext next methods can therefore throw a link ServiceConfigurationError if a providerconfiguration file violates the specified format or if it names a provider class that cannot be found and instantiated or if the result of instantiating the class is not assignable to the service type or if any other kind of exception or error is thrown as the next provider is located and instantiated To write robust code it is only necessary to catch link ServiceConfigurationError when using a service iterator If such an error is thrown then subsequent invocations of the iterator will make a best effort to locate and instantiate the next available provider but in general such recovery cannot be guaranteed span stylepaddingright em fontweight boldDesign Note Throwing an error in these cases may seem extreme The rationale for this behavior is that a malformed providerconfiguration file like a malformed class file indicates a serious problem with the way the Java virtual machine is configured or is being used As such it is preferable to throw an error rather than try to recover or even worse fail silently The iterator returned by this method does not support removal Invoking its link javautilIteratorremove remove method will cause an link UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown

Tests if this hashtable maps no keys to values
Returns an enumeration of the keys in this hashtable
Returns an enumeration of the values in this hashtable Use the Enumeration methods on the returned object to fetch the elements sequentially
Tests if some key maps into the specified value in this hashtable This operation is more expensive than the link containsKey containsKey method Note that this method is identical in functionality to link containsValue containsValue which is part of the link Map interface in the collections framework
Returns true if this hashtable maps one or more keys to this value Note that this method is identical in functionality to link contains contains which predates the link Map interface
Tests if the specified object is a key in this hashtable
Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped or code null if this map contains no mapping for the key More formally if this map contains a mapping from a key code k to a value code v such that code keyequalsk then this method returns code v otherwise it returns code null There can be at most one such mapping
Increases the capacity of and internally reorganizes this hashtable in order to accommodate and access its entries more efficiently This method is called automatically when the number of keys in the hashtable exceeds this hashtable's capacity and load factor
Maps the specified key to the specified value in this hashtable Neither the key nor the value can be null The value can be retrieved by calling the get method with a key that is equal to the original key
Removes the key and its corresponding value from this hashtable This method does nothing if the key is not in the hashtable
Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this hashtable These mappings will replace any mappings that this hashtable had for any of the keys currently in the specified map
Clears this hashtable so that it contains no keys
Creates a shallow copy of this hashtable All the structure of the hashtable itself is copied but the keys and values are not cloned This is a relatively expensive operation
Returns a string representation of this Hashtable object in the form of a set of entries enclosed in braces and separated by the ASCII characters nbsp comma and space Each entry is rendered as the key an equals sign and the associated element where the toString method is used to convert the key and element to strings
Returns a link Set view of the keys contained in this map The set is backed by the map so changes to the map are reflected in the set and viceversa If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress except through the iterator's own remove operation the results of the iteration are undefined The set supports element removal which removes the corresponding mapping from the map via the Iteratorremove Setremove removeAll retainAll and clear operations It does not support the add or addAll operations
Returns a link Set view of the mappings contained in this map The set is backed by the map so changes to the map are reflected in the set and viceversa If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress except through the iterator's own remove operation or through the setValue operation on a map entry returned by the iterator the results of the iteration are undefined The set supports element removal which removes the corresponding mapping from the map via the Iteratorremove Setremove removeAll retainAll and clear operations It does not support the add or addAll operations
Returns a link Collection view of the values contained in this map The collection is backed by the map so changes to the map are reflected in the collection and viceversa If the map is modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress except through the iterator's own remove operation the results of the iteration are undefined The collection supports element removal which removes the corresponding mapping from the map via the Iteratorremove Collectionremove removeAll retainAll and clear operations It does not support the add or addAll operations

Returns the hash code value for this Map as per the definition in the Map interface
Save the state of the Hashtable to a stream ie serialize it
Reconstitute the Hashtable from a stream ie deserialize it
The put method used by readObject This is provided because put is overridable and should not be called in readObject since the subclass will not yet be initialized This differs from the regular put method in several ways No checking for rehashing is necessary since the number of elements initially in the table is known The modCount is not incremented because we are creating a new instance Also no return value is needed
Initializes queue array with elements from the given Collection
Increases the capacity of the array
Inserts the specified element into this priority queue
Inserts the specified element into this priority queue
Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue if it is present More formally removes an element code e such that code oequalse if this queue contains one or more such elements Returns code true if and only if this queue contained the specified element or equivalently if this queue changed as a result of the call
Version of remove using reference equality not equals Needed by iteratorremove
Returns code true if this queue contains the specified element More formally returns code true if and only if this queue contains at least one element code e such that code oequalse
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue The elements are in no particular order The returned array will be safe in that no references to it are maintained by this queue In other words this method must allocate a new array The caller is thus free to modify the returned array This method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array The returned array elements are in no particular order If the queue fits in the specified array it is returned therein Otherwise a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue If the queue fits in the specified array with room to spare ie the array has more elements than the queue the element in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to code null Like the link toArray method this method acts as bridge between arraybased and collectionbased APIs Further this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array and may under certain circumstances be used to save allocation costs Suppose x is a queue known to contain only strings The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly allocated array of String String y xtoArraynew String Note that toArraynew Object is identical in function to toArray
Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue The iterator does not return the elements in any particular order
Removes all of the elements from this priority queue The queue will be empty after this call returns
Removes the ith element from queue Normally this method leaves the elements at up to i inclusive untouched Under these circumstances it returns null Occasionally in order to maintain the heap invariant it must swap a later element of the list with one earlier than i Under these circumstances this method returns the element that was previously at the end of the list and is now at some position before i This fact is used by iteratorremove so as to avoid missing traversing elements
Inserts item x at position k maintaining heap invariant by promoting x up the tree until it is greater than or equal to its parent or is the root To simplify and speed up coercions and comparisons the Comparable and Comparator versions are separated into different methods that are otherwise identical Similarly for siftDown
Inserts item x at position k maintaining heap invariant by demoting x down the tree repeatedly until it is less than or equal to its children or is a leaf
Establishes the heap invariant described above in the entire tree assuming nothing about the order of the elements prior to the call
Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this queue or code null if this queue is sorted according to the linkplain Comparable natural ordering of its elements
Saves the state of the instance to a stream that is serializes it
Reconstitutes the code PriorityQueue instance from a stream that is deserializes it
Inserts the specified element into this queue if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions returning true upon success and throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available This implementation returns true if offer succeeds else throws an IllegalStateException
Retrieves and removes the head of this queue This method differs from link poll poll only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty This implementation returns the result of poll unless the queue is empty
Retrieves but does not remove the head of this queue This method differs from link peek peek only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty This implementation returns the result of peek unless the queue is empty
Removes all of the elements from this queue The queue will be empty after this call returns This implementation repeatedly invokes link poll poll until it returns null
Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this queue Attempts to addAll of a queue to itself result in IllegalArgumentException Further the behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress This implementation iterates over the specified collection and adds each element returned by the iterator to this queue in turn A runtime exception encountered while trying to add an element including in particular a null element may result in only some of the elements having been successfully added when the associated exception is thrown

Sets all the calendar field values and the time value millisecond offset from the Epoch of this Calendar undefined This means that link isSetint isSet will return false for all the calendar fields and the date and time calculations will treat the fields as if they had never been set A Calendar implementation class may use its specific default field values for datetime calculations For example GregorianCalendar uses if the YEAR field value is undefined
Sets the given calendar field value and the time value millisecond offset from the Epoch of this Calendar undefined This means that link isSetint isSetfield will return false and the date and time calculations will treat the field as if it had never been set A Calendar implementation class may use the field's specific default value for date and time calculations The link HOUR_OF_DAY link HOUR and link AM_PM fields are handled independently and the a hreftime_resolutionthe resolution rule for the time of day is applied Clearing one of the fields doesn't reset the hour of day value of this Calendar Use link setintint setCalendarHOUR_OF_DAY to reset the hour value
Determines if the given calendar field has a value set including cases that the value has been set by internal fields calculations triggered by a get method call
Returns the string representation of the calendar field value in the given style and locale If no string representation is applicable null is returned This method calls link Calendargetint getfield to get the calendar field value if the string representation is applicable to the given calendar field For example if this Calendar is a GregorianCalendar and its date is then the string representation of the link MONTH field would be January in the long style in an English locale or Jan in the short style However no string representation would be available for the link DAY_OF_MONTH field and this method would return null The default implementation supports the calendar fields for which a link DateFormatSymbols has names in the given locale
Returns a Map containing all names of the calendar field in the given style and locale and their corresponding field values For example if this Calendar is a link GregorianCalendar the returned map would contain Jan to link JANUARY Feb to link FEBRUARY and so on in the linkplain SHORT short style in an English locale The values of other calendar fields may be taken into account to determine a set of display names For example if this Calendar is a lunisolar calendar system and the year value given by the link YEAR field has a leap month this method would return month names containing the leap month name and month names are mapped to their values specific for the year The default implementation supports display names contained in a link DateFormatSymbols For example if field is link MONTH and style is link ALL_STYLES this method returns a Map containing all strings returned by link DateFormatSymbolsgetShortMonths and link DateFormatSymbolsgetMonths

Compares the time values millisecond offsets from the a hrefEpochEpoch represented by two Calendar objects
Adds or subtracts the specified amount of time to the given calendar field based on the calendar's rules For example to subtract days from the current time of the calendar you can achieve it by calling addCalendarDAY_OF_MONTH 
Adds or subtracts updown a single unit of time on the given time field without changing larger fields For example to roll the current date up by one day you can achieve it by calling rollCalendarDATE true When rolling on the year or CalendarYEAR field it will roll the year value in the range between and the value returned by calling getMaximumCalendarYEAR When rolling on the month or CalendarMONTH field other fields like date might conflict and need to be changed For instance rolling the month on the date will result in When rolling on the hourinday or CalendarHOUR_OF_DAY field it will roll the hour value in the range between and which is zerobased
Adds the specified signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields A negative amount means to roll down NOTE This default implementation on Calendar just repeatedly calls the version of link rollintboolean roll that rolls by one unit This may not always do the right thing For example if the DAY_OF_MONTH field is rolling through February will leave it set to The GregorianCalendar version of this function takes care of this problem Other subclasses should also provide overrides of this function that do the right thing

Returns the absolute path name of a native library The VM invokes this method to locate the native libraries that belong to classes loaded with this class loader If this method returns null the VM searches the library along the path specified as the javalibrarypath property 
Sets the default assertion status for this class loader This setting determines whether classes loaded by this class loader and initialized in the future will have assertions enabled or disabled by default This setting may be overridden on a perpackage or perclass basis by invoking link setPackageAssertionStatusString boolean or link setClassAssertionStatusString boolean 
Sets the package default assertion status for the named package The package default assertion status determines the assertion status for classes initialized in the future that belong to the named package or any of its subpackages A subpackage of a package named p is any package whose name begins with p For example javaxswingtext is a subpackage of javaxswing and both javautil and javalangreflect are subpackages of java In the event that multiple package defaults apply to a given class the package default pertaining to the most specific package takes precedence over the others For example if javaxlang and javaxlangreflect both have package defaults associated with them the latter package default applies to classes in javaxlangreflect Package defaults take precedence over the class loader's default assertion status and may be overridden on a perclass basis by invoking link setClassAssertionStatusString boolean 
Sets the desired assertion status for the named toplevel class in this class loader and any nested classes contained therein This setting takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status and over any applicable perpackage default This method has no effect if the named class has already been initialized Once a class is initialized its assertion status cannot change If the named class is not a toplevel class this invocation will have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class 
Sets the default assertion status for this class loader to false and discards any package defaults or class assertion status settings associated with the class loader This method is provided so that class loaders can be made to ignore any command line or persistent assertion status settings and start with a clean slate 
Returns the assertion status that would be assigned to the specified class if it were to be initialized at the time this method is invoked If the named class has had its assertion status set the most recent setting will be returned otherwise if any package default assertion status pertains to this class the most recent setting for the most specific pertinent package default assertion status is returned otherwise this class loader's default assertion status is returned

Creates a localized description of this throwable Subclasses may override this method in order to produce a localespecific message For subclasses that do not override this method the default implementation returns the same result as getMessage
Returns the cause of this throwable or null if the cause is nonexistent or unknown The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown This implementation returns the cause that was supplied via one of the constructors requiring a Throwable or that was set after creation with the link initCauseThrowable method While it is typically unnecessary to override this method a subclass can override it to return a cause set by some other means This is appropriate for a legacy chained throwable that predates the addition of chained exceptions to Throwable Note that it is not necessary to override any of the PrintStackTrace methods all of which invoke the getCause method to determine the cause of a throwable
Initializes the cause of this throwable to the specified value The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown This method can be called at most once It is generally called from within the constructor or immediately after creating the throwable If this throwable was created with link ThrowableThrowable or link ThrowableStringThrowable this method cannot be called even once

Sets the stack trace elements that will be returned by link getStackTrace and printed by link printStackTrace and related methods This method which is designed for use by RPC frameworks and other advanced systems allows the client to override the default stack trace that is either generated by link fillInStackTrace when a throwable is constructed or deserialized when a throwable is read from a serialization stream

Registers the supplied transformer All future class definitions will be seen by the transformer except definitions of classes upon which any registered transformer is dependent The transformer is called when classes are loaded when they are linkplain redefineClasses redefined and if canRetransform is true when they are linkplain retransformClasses retransformed See link javalanginstrumentClassFileTransformertransform ClassFileTransformertransform for the order of transform calls If a transformer throws an exception during execution the JVM will still call the other registered transformers in order The same transformer may be added more than once but it is strongly discouraged avoid this by creating a new instance of tranformer class This method is intended for use in instrumentation as described in the linkplain Instrumentation class specification

Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports redefinition of classes The ability to redefine an already loaded class is an optional capability of a JVM Redefinition will only be supported if the CanRedefineClasses manifest attribute is set to true in the agent JAR file as described in the linkplain javalanginstrument package specification and the JVM supports this capability During a single instantiation of a single JVM multiple calls to this method will always return the same answer
Redefine the supplied set of classes using the supplied class files This method is used to replace the definition of a class without reference to the existing class file bytes as one might do when recompiling from source for fixandcontinue debugging Where the existing class file bytes are to be transformed for example in bytecode instrumentation link retransformClasses retransformClasses should be used This method operates on a set in order to allow interdependent changes to more than one class at the same time a redefinition of class A can require a redefinition of class B If a redefined method has active stack frames those active frames continue to run the bytecodes of the original method The redefined method will be used on new invokes This method does not cause any initialization except that which would occur under the customary JVM semantics In other words redefining a class does not cause its initializers to be run The values of static variables will remain as they were prior to the call Instances of the redefined class are not affected The redefinition may change method bodies the constant pool and attributes The redefinition must not add remove or rename fields or methods change the signatures of methods or change inheritance These restrictions maybe be lifted in future versions The class file bytes are not checked verified and installed until after the transformations have been applied if the resultant bytes are in error this method will throw an exception If this method throws an exception no classes have been redefined This method is intended for use in instrumentation as described in the linkplain Instrumentation class specification
Determines whether a class is modifiable by linkplain retransformClasses retransformation or linkplain redefineClasses redefinition If a class is modifiable then this method returns true If a class is not modifiable then this method returns false For a class to be retransformed link isRetransformClassesSupported must also be true But the value of isRetransformClassesSupported does not influence the value returned by this function For a class to be redefined link isRedefineClassesSupported must also be true But the value of isRedefineClassesSupported does not influence the value returned by this function Primitive classes for example javalangIntegerTYPE and array classes are never modifiable

Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the bootstrap class loader When the virtual machine's builtin class loader known as the bootstrap class loader unsuccessfully searches for a class the entries in the link javautiljarJarFile JAR file will be searched as well This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be searched in the order that this method was invoked The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any classes or resources other than those to be defined by the bootstrap class loader for the purpose of instrumentation Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected behaviour that is difficult to diagnose For example suppose there is a loader L and L's parent for delegation is the bootstrap class loader Furthermore a method in class C a class defined by L makes reference to a nonpublic accessor class C If the JAR file contains a class C then the delegation to the bootstrap class loader will cause C to be defined by the bootstrap class loader In this example an IllegalAccessError will be thrown that may cause the application to fail One approach to avoiding these types of issues is to use a unique package name for the instrumentation classes The Java Virtual Machine Specification specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the initial resolution attempt Consequently if the JAR file contains an entry that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference then subsequent attempts to resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt
Specifies a JAR file with instrumentation classes to be defined by the system class loader When the system class loader for delegation see link javalangClassLoadergetSystemClassLoader getSystemClassLoader unsuccessfully searches for a class the entries in the link javautiljarJarFile JarFile will be searched as well This method may be used multiple times to add multiple JAR files to be searched in the order that this method was invoked The agent should take care to ensure that the JAR does not contain any classes or resources other than those to be defined by the system class loader for the purpose of instrumentation Failure to observe this warning could result in unexpected behaviour that is difficult to diagnose see link appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch appendToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch The system class loader supports adding a JAR file to be searched if it implements a method named appendToClassPathForInstrumentation which takes a single parameter of type javalangString The method is not required to have public access The name of the JAR file is obtained by invoking the link javautilzipZipFilegetName getName method on the jarfile and this is provided as the parameter to the appendtoClassPathForInstrumentation method The Java Virtual Machine Specification specifies that a subsequent attempt to resolve a symbolic reference that the Java virtual machine has previously unsuccessfully attempted to resolve always fails with the same error that was thrown as a result of the initial resolution attempt Consequently if the JAR file contains an entry that corresponds to a class for which the Java virtual machine has unsuccessfully attempted to resolve a reference then subsequent attempts to resolve that reference will fail with the same error as the initial attempt This method does not change the value of javaclasspath link javalangSystemgetProperties system property
Returns whether the current JVM configuration supports linkplain setNativeMethodPrefixClassFileTransformerString setting a native method prefix The ability to set a native method prefix is an optional capability of a JVM Setting a native method prefix will only be supported if the CanSetNativeMethodPrefix manifest attribute is set to true in the agent JAR file as described in the linkplain javalanginstrument package specification and the JVM supports this capability During a single instantiation of a single JVM multiple calls to this method will always return the same answer
This method modifies the failure handling of native method resolution by allowing retry with a prefix applied to the name When used with the link javalanginstrumentClassFileTransformer ClassFileTransformer it enables native methods to be instrumented Since native methods cannot be directly instrumented they have no bytecodes they must be wrapped with a nonnative method which can be instrumented For example if we had native boolean fooint x We could transform the class file with the ClassFileTransformer during the initial definition of the class so that this becomes boolean fooint x record entry to foo return wrapped_foox native boolean wrapped_fooint x Where foo becomes a wrapper for the actual native method with the appended prefix wrapped_ Note that wrapped_ would be a poor choice of prefix since it might conceivably form the name of an existing method thus something like MyAgentWrapped_ would be better but would make these examples less readable The wrapper will allow data to be collected on the native method call but now the problem becomes linking up the wrapped method with the native implementation That is the method wrapped_foo needs to be resolved to the native implementation of foo which might be Java_somePackage_someClass_fooJNIEnv env jint x This function allows the prefix to be specified and the proper resolution to occur Specifically when the standard resolution fails the resolution is retried taking the prefix into consideration There are two ways that resolution occurs explicit resolution with the JNI function RegisterNatives and the normal automatic resolution For RegisterNatives the JVM will attempt this association methodfoo nativeImplementationfoo When this fails the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix prepended to the method name yielding the correct resolution methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationfoo For automatic resolution the JVM will attempt methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationwrapped_foo When this fails the resolution will be retried with the specified prefix deleted from the implementation name yielding the correct resolution methodwrapped_foo nativeImplementationfoo Note that since the prefix is only used when standard resolution fails native methods can be wrapped selectively Since each ClassFileTransformer can do its own transformation of the bytecodes more than one layer of wrappers may be applied Thus each transformer needs its own prefix Since transformations are applied in order the prefixes if applied will be applied in the same order see link addTransformerClassFileTransformerboolean addTransformer Thus if three transformers applied wrappers foo might become trans_trans_trans_foo But if say the second transformer did not apply a wrapper to foo it would be just trans_trans_foo To be able to efficiently determine the sequence of prefixes an intermediate prefix is only applied if its nonnative wrapper exists Thus in the last example even though trans_foo is not a native method the trans_ prefix is applied since trans_foo exists
Returns the class
Returns the array of bytes that contains the new class file
The implementation of this method may transform the supplied class file and return a new replacement class file There are two kinds of transformers determined by the canRetransform parameter of link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationaddTransformerClassFileTransformerboolean retransformation capable transformers that were added with canRetransform as true retransformation incapable transformers that were added with canRetransform as false or where added with link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationaddTransformerClassFileTransformer Once a transformer has been registered with link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationaddTransformerClassFileTransformerboolean addTransformer the transformer will be called for every new class definition and every class redefinition Retransformation capable transformers will also be called on every class retransformation The request for a new class definition is made with link javalangClassLoaderdefineClass ClassLoaderdefineClass or its native equivalents The request for a class redefinition is made with link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationredefineClasses InstrumentationredefineClasses or its native equivalents The request for a class retransformation is made with link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationretransformClasses InstrumentationretransformClasses or its native equivalents The transformer is called during the processing of the request before the class file bytes have been verified or applied When there are multiple transformers transformations are composed by chaining the transform calls That is the byte array returned by one call to transform becomes the input via the classfileBuffer parameter to the next call Transformations are applied in the following order Retransformation incapable transformers Retransformation incapable native transformers Retransformation capable transformers Retransformation capable native transformers For retransformations the retransformation incapable transformers are not called instead the result of the previous transformation is reused In all other cases this method is called Within each of these groupings transformers are called in the order registered Native transformers are provided by the ClassFileLoadHook event in the Java Virtual Machine Tool Interface The input via the classfileBuffer parameter to the first transformer is for new class definition the bytes passed to ClassLoaderdefineClass for class redefinition definitionsgetDefinitionClassFile where definitions is the parameter to link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationredefineClasses InstrumentationredefineClasses for class retransformation the bytes passed to the new class definition or if redefined the last redefinition with all transformations made by retransformation incapable transformers reapplied automatically and unaltered for details see link javalanginstrumentInstrumentationretransformClasses InstrumentationretransformClasses If the implementing method determines that no transformations are needed it should return null Otherwise it should create a new byte array copy the input classfileBuffer into it along with all desired transformations and return the new array The input classfileBuffer must not be modified In the retransform and redefine cases the transformer must support the redefinition semantics if a class that the transformer changed during initial definition is later retransformed or redefined the transformer must insure that the second class output class file is a legal redefinition of the first output class file If the transformer throws an exception which it doesn't catch subsequent transformers will still be called and the load redefine or retransform will still be attempted Thus throwing an exception has the same effect as returning null To prevent unexpected behavior when unchecked exceptions are generated in transformer code a transformer can catch Throwable If the transformer believes the classFileBuffer does not represent a validly formatted class file it should throw an IllegalClassFormatException while this has the same effect as returning null it facilitates the logging or debugging of format corruptions

Appends the string representation of the char array argument to this sequence The characters of the array argument are appended in order to the contents of this sequence The length of this sequence increases by the length of the argument The overall effect is exactly as if the argument were converted to a string by the method link StringvalueOfchar and the characters of that string were then link appendString appended to this character sequence
Appends the string representation of a subarray of the char array argument to this sequence Characters of the char array str starting at index offset are appended in order to the contents of this sequence The length of this sequence increases by the value of len The overall effect is exactly as if the arguments were converted to a string by the method link StringvalueOfcharintint and the characters of that string were then link appendString appended to this character sequence

Loads a code file with the specified filename from the local file system as a dynamic library The filename argument must be a complete path name The call Systemloadname is effectively equivalent to the call RuntimegetRuntimeloadname 
Loads the system library specified by the libname argument The manner in which a library name is mapped to the actual system library is system dependent The call SystemloadLibraryname is effectively equivalent to the call RuntimegetRuntimeloadLibraryname 
Maps a library name into a platformspecific string representing a native library
The following two methods exist because in out and err must be initialized to null The compiler however cannot be permitted to inline access to them since they are later set to more sensible values by initializeSystemClass
Initialize the system class Called after thread initialization
Returns the runtime class of this code Object The returned code Class object is the object that is locked by code static synchronized methods of the represented class The actual result type is code Class where code |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which code getClass is called For example no cast is required in this code fragment code Number n code Class c ngetClass 
Returns a hash code value for the object This method is supported for the benefit of hashtables such as those provided by javautilHashtable The general contract of hashCode is Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application If two objects are equal according to the equalsObject method then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the link javalangObjectequalsjavalangObject method then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results However the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables As much as is reasonably practical the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer but this implementation technique is not required by the JavaTM programming language
Indicates whether some other object is equal to this one The equals method implements an equivalence relation on nonnull object references It is reflexive for any nonnull reference value x xequalsx should return true It is symmetric for any nonnull reference values x and y xequalsy should return true if and only if yequalsx returns true It is transitive for any nonnull reference values x y and z if xequalsy returns true and yequalsz returns true then xequalsz should return true It is consistent for any nonnull reference values x and y multiple invocations of xequalsy consistently return true or consistently return false provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified For any nonnull reference value x xequalsnull should return false The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects that is for any nonnull reference values x and y this method returns true if and only if x and y refer to the same object x y has the value true Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes
Creates and returns a copy of this object The precise meaning of copy may depend on the class of the object The general intent is that for any object x the expression xclone x will be true and that the expression xclonegetClass xgetClass will be true but these are not absolute requirements While it is typically the case that xcloneequalsx will be true this is not an absolute requirement By convention the returned object should be obtained by calling superclone If a class and all of its superclasses except Object obey this convention it will be the case that xclonegetClass xgetClass By convention the object returned by this method should be independent of this object which is being cloned To achieve this independence it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned by superclone before returning it Typically this means copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal deep structure of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these objects with references to the copies If a class contains only primitive fields or references to immutable objects then it is usually the case that no fields in the object returned by superclone need to be modified The method clone for class Object performs a specific cloning operation First if the class of this object does not implement the interface Cloneable then a CloneNotSupportedException is thrown Note that all arrays are considered to implement the interface Cloneable Otherwise this method creates a new instance of the class of this object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of the corresponding fields of this object as if by assignment the contents of the fields are not themselves cloned Thus this method performs a shallow copy of this object not a deep copy operation The class Object does not itself implement the interface Cloneable so calling the clone method on an object whose class is Object will result in throwing an exception at run time
Returns a string representation of the object In general the toString method returns a string that textually represents this object The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read It is recommended that all subclasses override this method The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance the atsign character `' and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object In other words this method returns a string equal to the value of getClassgetName '' IntegertoHexStringhashCode 
Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor If any threads are waiting on this object one of them is chosen to be awakened The choice is arbitrary and occurs at the discretion of the implementation A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on this object The awakened thread will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be actively competing to synchronize on this object for example the awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor A thread becomes the owner of the object's monitor in one of three ways By executing a synchronized instance method of that object By executing the body of a synchronized statement that synchronizes on the object For objects of type Class by executing a synchronized static method of that class Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor
Wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor A thread waits on an object's monitor by calling one of the wait methods The awakened threads will not be able to proceed until the current thread relinquishes the lock on this object The awakened threads will compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be actively competing to synchronize on this object for example the awakened threads enjoy no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being the next thread to lock this object This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor
Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the link javalangObjectnotify method or the link javalangObjectnotifyAll method for this object or a specified amount of time has elapsed The current thread must own this object's monitor This method causes the current thread call it T to place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any and all synchronization claims on this object Thread T becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four things happens Some other thread invokes the notify method for this object and thread T happens to be arbitrarily chosen as the thread to be awakened Some other thread invokes the notifyAll method for this object Some other thread linkplain Threadinterrupt interrupts thread T The specified amount of real time has elapsed more or less If timeout is zero however then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits until notified The thread T is then removed from the wait set for this object and reenabled for thread scheduling It then competes in the usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the object once it has gained control of the object all its synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo ante that is to the situation as of the time that the wait method was invoked Thread T then returns from the invocation of the wait method Thus on return from the wait method the synchronization state of the object and of thread T is exactly as it was when the wait method was invoked A thread can also wake up without being notified interrupted or timing out a socalled spurious wakeup While this will rarely occur in practice applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened and continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied In other words waits should always occur in loops like this one synchronized obj while ltcondition does not holdgt objwaittimeout Perform action appropriate to condition For more information on this topic see Section in Doug Lea's Concurrent Programming in Java Second Edition AddisonWesley or Item in Joshua Bloch's Effective Java Programming Language Guide AddisonWesley If the current thread is linkplain javalangThreadinterrupt interrupted by any thread before or while it is waiting then an InterruptedException is thrown This exception is not thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as described above Note that the wait method as it places the current thread into the wait set for this object unlocks only this object any other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the link javalangObjectnotify method or the link javalangObjectnotifyAll method for this object or some other thread interrupts the current thread or a certain amount of real time has elapsed This method is similar to the wait method of one argument but it allows finer control over the amount of time to wait for a notification before giving up The amount of real time measured in nanoseconds is given by timeoutnanos In all other respects this method does the same thing as the method link waitlong of one argument In particular wait means the same thing as wait The current thread must own this object's monitor The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until either of the following two conditions has occurred Another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the notifyAll method The timeout period specified by timeout milliseconds plus nanos nanoseconds arguments has elapsed The thread then waits until it can reobtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution As in the one argument version interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible and this method should always be used in a loop synchronized obj while ltcondition does not holdgt objwaittimeout nanos Perform action appropriate to condition This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor
Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the link javalangObjectnotify method or the link javalangObjectnotifyAll method for this object In other words this method behaves exactly as if it simply performs the call wait The current thread must own this object's monitor The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this object's monitor to wake up either through a call to the notify method or the notifyAll method The thread then waits until it can reobtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution As in the one argument version interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible and this method should always be used in a loop synchronized obj while ltcondition does not holdgt objwait Perform action appropriate to condition This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object's monitor See the notify method for a description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of a monitor
Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object A subclass overrides the finalize method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup The general contract of finalize is that it is invoked if and when the JavaTM virtual machine has determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died except as a result of an action taken by the finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be finalized The finalize method may take any action including making this object available again to other threads the usual purpose of finalize however is to perform cleanup actions before the object is irrevocably discarded For example the finalize method for an object that represents an inputoutput connection might perform explicit IO transactions to break the connection before the object is permanently discarded The finalize method of class Object performs no special action it simply returns normally Subclasses of Object may override this definition The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will invoke the finalize method for any given object It is guaranteed however that the thread that invokes finalize will not be holding any uservisible synchronization locks when finalize is invoked If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates After the finalize method has been invoked for an object no further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has not yet died including possible actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized at which point the object may be discarded The finalize method is never invoked more than once by a Java virtual machine for any given object Any exception thrown by the finalize method causes the finalization of this object to be halted but is otherwise ignored

Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its shutdown sequence This method never returns normally The argument serves as a status code by convention a nonzero status code indicates abnormal termination The virtual machine's shutdown sequence consists of two phases In the first phase all registered link addShutdownHook shutdown hooks if any are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run concurrently until they finish In the second phase all uninvoked finalizers are run if link runFinalizersOnExit finalizationonexit has been enabled Once this is done the virtual machine link halt halts If this method is invoked after the virtual machine has begun its shutdown sequence then if shutdown hooks are being run this method will block indefinitely If shutdown hooks have already been run and onexit finalization has been enabled then this method halts the virtual machine with the given status code if the status is nonzero otherwise it blocks indefinitely The link Systemexitint Systemexit method is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method 
Registers a new virtualmachine shutdown hook The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds of events The program exits normally when the last nondaemon thread exits or when the link exit exit equivalently link Systemexitint Systemexit method is invoked or The virtual machine is terminated in response to a user interrupt such as typing ^C or a systemwide event such as user logoff or system shutdown A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted thread When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let them run concurrently When all the hooks have finished it will then run all uninvoked finalizers if finalizationonexit has been enabled Finally the virtual machine will halt Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown sequence as will nondaemon threads if shutdown was initiated by invoking the link exit exit method Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by invoking the link halt halt method which forcibly terminates the virtual machine Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a new shutdown hook or deregister a previouslyregistered hook Attempting either of these operations will cause an link IllegalStateException to be thrown Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual machine and should therefore be coded defensively They should in particular be written to be threadsafe and to avoid deadlocks insofar as possible They should also not rely blindly upon services that may have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in the process of shutting down Attempts to use other threadbased services such as the AWT eventdispatch thread for example may lead to deadlocks Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly When a program invokes link exit exit the expectation is that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit When the virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in which to shut down and exit It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any user interaction or to perform a longrunning computation in a shutdown hook Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any other thread by invoking the link ThreadGroupuncaughtException uncaughtException method of the thread's link ThreadGroup object The default implementation of this method prints the exception's stack trace to link Systemerr and terminates the thread it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or halt In rare circumstances the virtual machine may abort that is stop running without shutting down cleanly This occurs when the virtual machine is terminated externally for example with the SIGKILL signal on Unix or the TerminateProcess call on Microsoft Windows The virtual machine may also abort if a native method goes awry by for example corrupting internal data structures or attempting to access nonexistent memory If the virtual machine aborts then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks will be run 
Deregisters a previouslyregistered virtualmachine shutdown hook 
Forcibly terminates the currently running Java virtual machine This method never returns normally This method should be used with extreme caution Unlike the link exit exit method this method does not cause shutdown hooks to be started and does not run uninvoked finalizers if finalizationonexit has been enabled If the shutdown sequence has already been initiated then this method does not wait for any running shutdown hooks or finalizers to finish their work 
Enable or disable finalization on exit doing so specifies that the finalizers of all objects that have finalizers that have not yet been automatically invoked are to be run before the Java runtime exits By default finalization on exit is disabled If there is a security manager its checkExit method is first called with as its argument to ensure the exit is allowed This could result in a SecurityException
Executes the specified string command in a separate process This is a convenience method An invocation of the form execcommand behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation link execString String File execcommand null null
Executes the specified string command in a separate process with the specified environment This is a convenience method An invocation of the form execcommand envp behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation link execString String File execcommand envp null
Executes the specified string command in a separate process with the specified environment and working directory This is a convenience method An invocation of the form execcommand envp dir behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation link execString String File execcmdarray envp dir where cmdarray is an array of all the tokens in command More precisely the command string is broken into tokens using a link StringTokenizer created by the call new link StringTokenizercommand with no further modification of the character categories The tokens produced by the tokenizer are then placed in the new string array cmdarray in the same order

Executes the specified command and arguments in a separate process with the specified environment This is a convenience method An invocation of the form execcmdarray envp behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation link execString String File execcmdarray envp null
Executes the specified command and arguments in a separate process with the specified environment and working directory Given an array of strings cmdarray representing the tokens of a command line and an array of strings envp representing environment variable settings this method creates a new process in which to execute the specified command This method checks that cmdarray is a valid operating system command Which commands are valid is systemdependent but at the very least the command must be a nonempty list of nonnull strings If envp is null the subprocess inherits the environment settings of the current process link ProcessBuilderstart is now the preferred way to start a process with a modified environment The working directory of the new subprocess is specified by dir If dir is null the subprocess inherits the current working directory of the current process If a security manager exists its link SecurityManagercheckExec checkExec method is invoked with the first component of the array cmdarray as its argument This may result in a link SecurityException being thrown Starting an operating system process is highly systemdependent Among the many things that can go wrong are The operating system program file was not found Access to the program file was denied The working directory does not exist In such cases an exception will be thrown The exact nature of the exception is systemdependent but it will always be a subclass of link IOException
Returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine This value may change during a particular invocation of the virtual machine Applications that are sensitive to the number of available processors should therefore occasionally poll this property and adjust their resource usage appropriately 
Returns the amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine Calling the gc method may result in increasing the value returned by freeMemory

Returns the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use If there is no inherent limit then the value link javalangLongMAX_VALUE will be returned 
Runs the garbage collector Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse When control returns from the method call the virtual machine has made its best effort to recycle all discarded objects The name gc stands for garbage collector The virtual machine performs this recycling process automatically as needed in a separate thread even if the gc method is not invoked explicitly The method link Systemgc is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method
Runs the finalization methods of any objects pending finalization Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend effort toward running the finalize methods of objects that have been found to be discarded but whose finalize methods have not yet been run When control returns from the method call the virtual machine has made a best effort to complete all outstanding finalizations The virtual machine performs the finalization process automatically as needed in a separate thread if the runFinalization method is not invoked explicitly The method link SystemrunFinalization is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method
EnablesDisables tracing of instructions If the boolean argument is true this method suggests that the Java virtual machine emit debugging information for each instruction in the virtual machine as it is executed The format of this information and the file or other output stream to which it is emitted depends on the host environment The virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support this feature The destination of the trace output is system dependent If the boolean argument is false this method causes the virtual machine to stop performing the detailed instruction trace it is performing
EnablesDisables tracing of method calls If the boolean argument is true this method suggests that the Java virtual machine emit debugging information for each method in the virtual machine as it is called The format of this information and the file or other output stream to which it is emitted depends on the host environment The virtual machine may ignore this request if it does not support this feature Calling this method with argument false suggests that the virtual machine cease emitting percall debugging information
Loads the specified filename as a dynamic library The filename argument must be a complete path name for example RuntimegetRuntimeloadhomeavhliblibXso First if there is a security manager its checkLink method is called with the filename as its argument This may result in a security exception This is similar to the method link loadLibraryString but it accepts a general file name as an argument rather than just a library name allowing any file of native code to be loaded The method link SystemloadString is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method
Loads the dynamic library with the specified library name A file containing native code is loaded from the local file system from a place where library files are conventionally obtained The details of this process are implementationdependent The mapping from a library name to a specific filename is done in a systemspecific manner First if there is a security manager its checkLink method is called with the libname as its argument This may result in a security exception The method link SystemloadLibraryString is the conventional and convenient means of invoking this method If native methods are to be used in the implementation of a class a standard strategy is to put the native code in a library file call it LibFile and then to put a static initializer static SystemloadLibraryLibFile within the class declaration When the class is loaded and initialized the necessary native code implementation for the native methods will then be loaded as well If this method is called more than once with the same library name the second and subsequent calls are ignored
Creates a localized version of an input stream This method takes an InputStream and returns an InputStream equivalent to the argument in all respects except that it is localized as characters in the local character set are read from the stream they are automatically converted from the local character set to Unicode If the argument is already a localized stream it may be returned as the result
Creates a localized version of an output stream This method takes an OutputStream and returns an OutputStream equivalent to the argument in all respects except that it is localized as Unicode characters are written to the stream they are automatically converted to the local character set If the argument is already a localized stream it may be returned as the result
Returns a reference to the currently executing thread object
Causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute
Causes the currently executing thread to sleep temporarily cease execution for the specified number of milliseconds subject to the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers The thread does not lose ownership of any monitors

Initializes a Thread
Returns a clone if the class of this object is link Cloneable Cloneable
Causes this thread to begin execution the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread The result is that two threads are running concurrently the current thread which returns from the call to the start method and the other thread which executes its run method It is never legal to start a thread more than once In particular a thread may not be restarted once it has completed execution
If this thread was constructed using a separate Runnable run object then that Runnable object's run method is called otherwise this method does nothing and returns Subclasses of Thread should override this method
This method is called by the system to give a Thread a chance to clean up before it actually exits
Forces the thread to stop executing If there is a security manager installed its checkAccess method is called with this as its argument This may result in a SecurityException being raised in the current thread If this thread is different from the current thread that is the current thread is trying to stop a thread other than itself the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermissionstopThread argument is called in addition Again this may result in throwing a SecurityException in the current thread The thread represented by this thread is forced to stop whatever it is doing abnormally and to throw a newly created ThreadDeath object as an exception It is permitted to stop a thread that has not yet been started If the thread is eventually started it immediately terminates An application should not normally try to catch ThreadDeath unless it must do some extraordinary cleanup operation note that the throwing of ThreadDeath causes finally clauses of try statements to be executed before the thread officially dies If a catch clause catches a ThreadDeath object it is important to rethrow the object so that the thread actually dies The toplevel error handler that reacts to otherwise uncaught exceptions does not print out a message or otherwise notify the application if the uncaught exception is an instance of ThreadDeath
Forces the thread to stop executing If there is a security manager installed the checkAccess method of this thread is called which may result in a SecurityException being raised in the current thread If this thread is different from the current thread that is the current thread is trying to stop a thread other than itself or obj is not an instance of ThreadDeath the security manager's checkPermission method with the RuntimePermissionstopThread argument is called in addition Again this may result in throwing a SecurityException in the current thread If the argument obj is null a NullPointerException is thrown in the current thread The thread represented by this thread is forced to stop whatever it is doing abnormally and to throw the Throwable object obj as an exception This is an unusual action to take normally the stop method that takes no arguments should be used It is permitted to stop a thread that has not yet been started If the thread is eventually started it immediately terminates
Common impl for stop and stopThrowable
Interrupts this thread Unless the current thread is interrupting itself which is always permitted the link checkAccess checkAccess method of this thread is invoked which may cause a link SecurityException to be thrown If this thread is blocked in an invocation of the link Objectwait wait link Objectwaitlong waitlong or link Objectwaitlong int waitlong int methods of the link Object class or of the link join link joinlong link joinlong int link sleeplong or link sleeplong int methods of this class then its interrupt status will be cleared and it will receive an link InterruptedException If this thread is blocked in an IO operation upon an link javaniochannelsInterruptibleChannel interruptible channel then the channel will be closed the thread's interrupt status will be set and the thread will receive a link javaniochannelsClosedByInterruptException If this thread is blocked in a link javaniochannelsSelector then the thread's interrupt status will be set and it will return immediately from the selection operation possibly with a nonzero value just as if the selector's link javaniochannelsSelectorwakeup wakeup method were invoked If none of the previous conditions hold then this thread's interrupt status will be set Interrupting a thread that is not alive need not have any effect
Tests whether the current thread has been interrupted The interrupted status of the thread is cleared by this method In other words if this method were to be called twice in succession the second call would return false unless the current thread were interrupted again after the first call had cleared its interrupted status and before the second call had examined it A thread interruption ignored because a thread was not alive at the time of the interrupt will be reflected by this method returning false
Tests whether this thread has been interrupted The interrupted status of the thread is unaffected by this method A thread interruption ignored because a thread was not alive at the time of the interrupt will be reflected by this method returning false
Tests if some Thread has been interrupted The interrupted state is reset or not based on the value of ClearInterrupted that is passed
Throws link NoSuchMethodError
Tests if this thread is alive A thread is alive if it has been started and has not yet died
Suspends this thread First the checkAccess method of this thread is called with no arguments This may result in throwing a SecurityException in the current thread If the thread is alive it is suspended and makes no further progress unless and until it is resumed
Resumes a suspended thread First the checkAccess method of this thread is called with no arguments This may result in throwing a SecurityException in the current thread If the thread is alive but suspended it is resumed and is permitted to make progress in its execution
Changes the priority of this thread First the checkAccess method of this thread is called with no arguments This may result in throwing a SecurityException Otherwise the priority of this thread is set to the smaller of the specified newPriority and the maximum permitted priority of the thread's thread group
Returns this thread's priority
Changes the name of this thread to be equal to the argument name First the checkAccess method of this thread is called with no arguments This may result in throwing a SecurityException
Returns this thread's name
Returns the thread group to which this thread belongs This method returns null if this thread has died been stopped
Returns the number of active threads in the current thread's thread group
Copies into the specified array every active thread in the current thread's thread group and its subgroups This method simply calls the enumerate method of the current thread's thread group with the array argument First if there is a security manager that enumerate method calls the security manager's checkAccess method with the thread group as its argument This may result in throwing a SecurityException
Counts the number of stack frames in this thread The thread must be suspended
Waits at most millis milliseconds for this thread to die A timeout of means to wait forever
Waits at most millis milliseconds plus nanos nanoseconds for this thread to die
Waits for this thread to die
Prints a stack trace of the current thread to the standard error stream This method is used only for debugging
Marks this thread as either a daemon thread or a user thread The Java Virtual Machine exits when the only threads running are all daemon threads This method must be called before the thread is started This method first calls the checkAccess method of this thread with no arguments This may result in throwing a SecurityException in the current thread
Tests if this thread is a daemon thread
Determines if the currently running thread has permission to modify this thread If there is a security manager its checkAccess method is called with this thread as its argument This may result in throwing a SecurityException
Returns a string representation of this thread including the thread's name priority and thread group
Returns the context ClassLoader for this Thread The context ClassLoader is provided by the creator of the thread for use by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources If not set the default is the ClassLoader context of the parent Thread The context ClassLoader of the primordial thread is typically set to the class loader used to load the application First if there is a security manager and the caller's class loader is not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the context class loader for the thread whose context class loader is being requested then the security manager's checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermissiongetClassLoader permission to see if it's ok to get the context ClassLoader
Sets the context ClassLoader for this Thread The context ClassLoader can be set when a thread is created and allows the creator of the thread to provide the appropriate class loader to code running in the thread when loading classes and resources First if there is a security manager its checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermissionsetContextClassLoader permission to see if it's ok to set the context ClassLoader
Returns true if and only if the current thread holds the monitor lock on the specified object This method is designed to allow a program to assert that the current thread already holds a specified lock assert ThreadholdsLockobj 
Returns an array of stack trace elements representing the stack dump of this thread This method will return a zerolength array if this thread has not started or has terminated If the returned array is of nonzero length then the first element of the array represents the top of the stack which is the most recent method invocation in the sequence The last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence If there is a security manager and this thread is not the current thread then the security manager's checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermissiongetStackTrace permission to see if it's ok to get the stack trace Some virtual machines may under some circumstances omit one or more stack frames from the stack trace In the extreme case a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning this thread is permitted to return a zerolength array from this method
Returns a map of stack traces for all live threads The map keys are threads and each map value is an array of StackTraceElement that represents the stack dump of the corresponding Thread The returned stack traces are in the format specified for the link getStackTrace getStackTrace method The threads may be executing while this method is called The stack trace of each thread only represents a snapshot and each stack trace may be obtained at different time A zerolength array will be returned in the map value if the virtual machine has no stack trace information about a thread If there is a security manager then the security manager's checkPermission method is called with a RuntimePermissiongetStackTrace permission as well as RuntimePermissionmodifyThreadGroup permission to see if it is ok to get the stack trace of all threads
Verifies that this possibly subclass instance can be constructed without violating security constraints the subclass must not override securitysensitive nonfinal methods or else the enableContextClassLoaderOverride RuntimePermission is checked
Performs reflective checks on given subclass to verify that it doesn't override securitysensitive nonfinal methods Returns true if the subclass overrides any of the methods false otherwise
Returns the identifier of this Thread The thread ID is a positive long number generated when this thread was created The thread ID is unique and remains unchanged during its lifetime When a thread is terminated this thread ID may be reused
Returns the state of this thread This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state not for synchronization control
Set the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception and no other handler has been defined for that thread Uncaught exception handling is controlled first by the thread then by the thread's link ThreadGroup object and finally by the default uncaught exception handler If the thread does not have an explicit uncaught exception handler set and the thread's thread group including parent thread groups does not specialize its uncaughtException method then the default handler's uncaughtException method will be invoked By setting the default uncaught exception handler an application can change the way in which uncaught exceptions are handled such as logging to a specific device or file for those threads that would already accept whatever quotdefaultquot behavior the system provided Note that the default uncaught exception handler should not usually defer to the thread's ThreadGroup object as that could cause infinite recursion
Returns the default handler invoked when a thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception If the returned value is null there is no default
Returns the handler invoked when this thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception If this thread has not had an uncaught exception handler explicitly set then this thread's ThreadGroup object is returned unless this thread has terminated in which case null is returned
Set the handler invoked when this thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception A thread can take full control of how it responds to uncaught exceptions by having its uncaught exception handler explicitly set If no such handler is set then the thread's ThreadGroup object acts as its handler
Dispatch an uncaught exception to the handler This method is intended to be called only by the JVM
Method invoked when the given thread terminates due to the given uncaught exception Any exception thrown by this method will be ignored by the Java Virtual Machine
Method invoked when the given thread terminates due to the given uncaught exception Any exception thrown by this method will be ignored by the Java Virtual Machine
Method invoked when the given thread terminates due to the given uncaught exception Any exception thrown by this method will be ignored by the Java Virtual Machine
Returns the length of this character sequence The length is the number of bit chars in the sequence
Returns the char value at the specified index An index ranges from zero to length The first char value of the sequence is at index zero the next at index one and so on as for array indexing If the char value specified by the index is a surrogate the surrogate value is returned
Returns a new CharSequence that is a subsequence of this sequence The subsequence starts with the char value at the specified index and ends with the char value at index end The length in chars of the returned sequence is end start so if start end then an empty sequence is returned 
Returns a string containing the characters in this sequence in the same order as this sequence The length of the string will be the length of this sequence
